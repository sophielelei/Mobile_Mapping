Abstract = {Water scarcity threatens irrigated agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa
   (SSA). Knowledge of farmers' perceptions and drivers for decision-making
   in view of coping with water scarcity is so far lacking but needed to
   improve local technologies and frame policies fostering their adoption.
   Here, for the first time, we investigated farmers' perception of water
   scarcity, key adaptation strategies, and the determinants of their
   adoption in irrigated rice schemes in dry climatic zones of West Africa.
   We surveyed 572 farming households and conducted expert interviews with
   key informants in four contrasting irrigated rice schemes in Burkina
   Faso between April 2018 and August 2019. Information was gathered on
   biophysical field characteristics, grain yields, agronomic and water
   management practices, farmers' perception of water scarcity, their
   adaptive responses, and social-economic attributes of adopting
   households. Nearly 80\% of the respondents reported having experienced
   water scarcity during the past 5 years. To cope with the adverse effect
   of water scarcity, farmers implemented seventeen different adaptation
   strategies that could be categorized into seven groups. Most popular
   among those were ``water and soil conservation practices{''} (consisting
   mainly of field bunding and leveling), ``no rice cultivation,{''} and
   ``crop rotation.{''} Farmers in drier areas (Sudano-Sahelian zone) were
   less likely to adopt and implement several adaptation strategies to
   water scarcity compared to farmers in wetter areas (Sudanian zone).
   Belonging to farming associations increased the probability of
   implementing several strategies to alleviate water scarcity, while
   female-headed households tended to have a lower propensity to adopt and
   implement concomitantly several adaptation strategies in comparison with
   their male counterpart. The dissemination of scheme- and
   household-specific technology options could contribute to mitigating
   water scarcity in irrigated rice-based systems in the dry climatic zones
   of West Africa, thus contributing to rural livelihood and food security.},

Title = {The spinal posture of computing adolescents in a real-life setting},
Journal = {BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {Background: It is assumed that good postural alignment is associated
   with the less likelihood of musculoskeletal pain symptoms. Encouraging
   good sitting postures have not reported consequent musculoskeletal pain
   reduction in school-based populations, possibly due to a lack of clear
   understanding of good posture. Therefore this paper describes the
   variability of postural angles in a cohort of asymptomatic high-school
   students whilst working on desk-top computers in a school computer
   classroom and to report on the relationship between the postural angles
   and age, gender, height, weight and computer use.
   Methods: The baseline data from a 12 month longitudinal study is
   reported. The study was conducted in South African school computer
   classrooms. 194 Grade 10 high-school students, from randomly selected
   high-schools, aged 15-17 years, enrolled in Computer Application
   Technology for the first time, asymptomatic during the preceding month,
   and from whom written informed consent were obtained, participated in
   the study. The 3D Posture Analysis Tool captured five postural angles
   (head flexion, neck flexion, cranio-cervical angle, trunk flexion and
   head lateral bend) while the students were working on desk-top
   computers. Height, weight and computer use were also measured.
   Individual and combinations of postural angles were analysed.
   Results: 944 Students were screened for eligibility of which the data of
   194 students are reported. Trunk flexion was the most variable angle.
   Increased neck flexion and the combination of increased head flexion,
   neck flexion and trunk flexion were significantly associated with
   increased weight and BMI (p = 0.0001).
   Conclusions: High-school students sit with greater ranges of trunk
   flexion (leaning forward or reclining) when using the classroom
   computer. Increased weight is significantly associated with increased
   sagittal plane postural angles.},

Title = {Determinants of adolescent pregnancy in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic
   review},
Journal = {REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JAN 27},
Abstract = {Background: Adolescent pregnancy has been persistently high in
   sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of this review is to identify factors
   influencing adolescent pregnancies in sub-Saharan Africa in order to
   design appropriate intervention program.
   Methods: A search in MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of science, and Google Scholar
   databases with the following keywords: determinants, factors, reasons,
   sociocultural factors, adolescent pregnancy, unintended pregnancies, and
   sub-Saharan Africa. Qualitative and cross-sectional studies intended to
   assess factors influencing adolescent pregnancies as the primary outcome
   variable in sub-Saharan Africa were included. Our search was limited to,
   articles published from the year 2000 to 2017 in English. Twenty-four
   (24) original articles met the inclusion criteria.
   Results: The study identified Sociocultural, environmental and Economic
   factors (Peer influence, unwanted sexual advances from adult males,
   coercive sexual relations, unequal gender power relations, poverty,
   religion, early marriage, lack of parental counseling and guidance,
   parental neglect, absence of affordable or free education, lack of
   comprehensive sexuality education, non-use of contraceptives, male's
   responsibility to buy condoms, early sexual debut and inappropriate
   forms of recreation). Individual factors (excessive use of alcohol,
   substance abuse, educational status, low self-esteem, and inability to
   resist sexual temptation, curiosity, and cell phone usage). Health
   service-related factors (cost of contraceptives, Inadequate and
   unskilled health workers, long waiting time and lack of privacy at
   clinics, lack of comprehensive sexuality education, misconceptions about
   contraceptives, and non-friendly adolescent reproductive services,) as
   influencing adolescent pregnancies in Sub-Saharan Africa
   Conclusion: High levels of adolescent pregnancies in Sub-Saharan Africa
   is attributable to multiple factors. Our study, however, categorized
   these factors into three major themes; sociocultural and economic,
   individual, and health service related factors as influencing adolescent
   pregnancies. Community sensitization, comprehensive sexuality education
   and ensuring girls enroll and stay in schools could reduce adolescent
   pregnancy rates. Also, provision of adolescent-friendly health services
   in schools and healthcare centers and initiating adolescent empowerment
   programs could have a positive impact.},

Abstract = {E-Government development in most SADC countries is still in its initial
   stages compared to 1st world countries. Also, SADC member states have
   realized the benefits inherent in e-Government development projects and
   therefore have undertaken the task of implementing. these in order to
   add value to their respective citizens. Their problem, however, is to
   find a referral framework that can guide them when implementing such
   projects. Some countries are very poor that any investment in
   e-government projects may use a very big portion of their gross domestic
   earnings. This therefore requires sufficient planning to reduce the
   risks associated with such capital expenditures. Using data from the CIA
   fact file, this research proposes a framework that can be adopted by
   member SADC states when implementing e-Government projects. Like in any
   other e-business model, Internet plays a major role as the medium of
   communication in e-government projects. The research study has revealed
   that internet use is highly correlated to the number of cell phones
   (0.965), fixed telephone lines(0.985), television broadcasting stations(
   0.980), but has a very low correlation with the literacy level (0.333)
   of a country. However, television broadcasting stations, to a certain
   degree, informs the level of e-Government awareness. Therefore, level of
   awareness is correlated to literacy rate but not to the number of
   Internet users. Hence there is no correlation between the literacy rate
   and the likelihood of citizens accessing e-Government services. The
   research did not consider other softer aspects that may impact the
   uptake and use of e-government services such as social background,
   gender, income levels as well as types of services that are required by
   the populace.},

Abstract = {Tertiary institutions in South Africa are experiencing alarming
   undergraduate drop-out rates. This has partly been attributed to
   students' inadequate preparation, and failure to gather information on,
   and planning for, their careers. The need for sound career guidance at
   the high school level is key, making the role of Life Orientation (LO)
   increasingly prominent. The aim of this study was to determine what
   benefits high school learners derive from attending career talks. To
   this end, a qualitative study was conducted with Grade 10 learners
   studying STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) at a
   township high school in Mamelodi, Tshwane. Data were collected using a
   qualitative questionnaire and analysed thematically. The findings
   demonstrated the importance of role models sharing information on their
   careers and work experiences. Another finding pertained to the
   importance of information on diverse careers, for the development of
   learners' career self efficacy as students of STEM in a township high
   school context. The findings highlight the importance of LO teachers
   organising career workshops. The study will benefit the Department of
   Basic Education, businesses, and employers as key stakeholders, by
   helping to enhance the career development of future employees and
   entrepreneurs.},

Abstract = {Fertilizer use in Nigeria is estimated at 13 kg/ha, which is far below
   the 200 kg/ha recommended by the Food and Agricultural Organization
   (FAO). The objective of this investigation was to identify the
   determinant factors of farmers' participation in Nigeria's Growth
   Enhancement Support Scheme (GESS). In addition, we determined the impact
   of the GESS on fertilizer use in rural areas. A total of 1,200 rural
   farmers were sampled across the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria.
   Results from the use of a recursive bivariate probit model indicated
   that GESS significantly impacted on the access and usage of fertilizer
   among the rural farmers; and that contact with extension agents,
   ownership of mobile phones, power for charging phone batteries, value
   output, mobile network coverage, ability to read and write were positive
   determinants of rural farmers' participation in the GESS; whereas
   increased distance to registration and collection centers, and cultural
   constraints to married women reduced farmers' tendency to participate in
   the GESS. The findings suggest that farmers' participation in the GESS
   is a critical factor for raising fertilizer use in Nigeria. This implies
   that food security in sub-Saharan Africa can be achieved by increasing
   the participation of rural farmers in the GESS.},

Title = {Farmer perceptions and willingness to pay for novel livestock pest
   control technologies: A case of tsetse repellent collar in Kwale County
   in Kenya},
Journal = {PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Tsetse-transmitted Animal African Trypanosomosis (AAT) is one of the
   most important constraints to livestock development in Africa. Use of
   trypanocides has been the most widespread approach for the management of
   AAT, despite the associated drug resistance and health concerns
   associated with drug metabolites in animal products. Alternative control
   measures that target tsetse fly vectors of AAT, though effective, have
   been hard to sustain in part because these are public goods applied
   area-wide. The International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology
   (icipe) and partners have developed and implemented a novel tsetse
   repellent collar (TRC) applied on animals to limit contact of tsetse
   flies and livestock, thereby reducing AAT transmission. The TRC has now
   advanced to commercialization. A household-level survey involving 632
   cattle keeping households, was conducted in Shimba Hills region of Kwale
   County, where field trials of the TRC have been previously conducted to
   assess farmers' knowledge, perception, and practices towards the
   management of tsetse flies, their willingness to pay (WTP) for the TRC,
   and factors affecting the WTP. Almost all the respondents (90\%)
   reported that tsetse flies were the leading cattle infesting pests in
   the area. About 22\% of these correctly identified at least four AAT
   clinical signs, and even though many (68\%) used trypanocidal drugs to
   manage the disease, 50\% did not perceive the drug as being effective in
   AAT management (50\%). Few respondents (8\%) were aware of the harmful
   effects of trypanocidal drugs. About 89\% of the respondents were aware
   of icipe TRC, and 30\% of them were using the field trial collars during
   the survey. Sixty-three (63\%) of them were willing to pay for the TRC
   at the same cost they spend treating an animal for AAT. On average
   farmers were willing to pay KES 3,352 per animal per year. Male educated
   household heads are likely to pay more for the TRC. Moreover, perceived
   high AAT prevalence and severity further increases the WTP. Wider
   dissemination and commercialization of the herd-level tsetse control
   approach (TRC) should be encouraged to impede AAT transmission and thus
   enhance food security and farm incomes among the affected rural
   communities. Besides the uptake of TRC can be enhanced through training,
   especially among women farmers.
   Author summary Animal African Trypanosomosis is a tropical disease that
   is of economic importance in Sub-Saharan Africa. The livestock
   sub-sector supports approximately 600 million smallholders in developing
   countries through employment, income from livestock products, and
   improving crop productivity through draft power and manure. Efforts to
   reduce rural poverty and improve food security and nutrition, therefore,
   require utilizing livestock to their full potential. Trypanosomosis
   results in anemia, emaciation, productivity loss, and mortality, and
   remains a leading constraint to livestock development in Africa. To
   reduce the risks associated with the use of trypanocides, alternative
   control measures that target the vector- tsetse fly need to be developed
   and widely disseminated. The International Centre of Insect Physiology
   and Ecology (icipe) and partners have-developed and implemented a novel
   tsetse repellent collar that shields animals from getting into contact
   with the vector, thereby preventing trypanosomosis transmission. The
   collar has now advanced to a commercialization stage. We conducted
   community and household-level surveys to assess farmer's knowledge,
   perception, and practices regarding tsetse pest and trypanosomosis, and
   their willingness to pay for the novel tsetse repellent collar. We found
   that the pest is the main cattle production constraint and the cause of
   the associated disease, although there exists a gap in the
   identification of the clinical signs of the disease. Besides, most
   farmers rely on trypanocidal drugs for the treatment of their animals
   despite their human health and environmental risks. However, the
   majority were willing to buy the newly developed canvas collar. A male
   head of a household with a higher level of education is likely to pay
   more for the novel tsetse repellent collar. Besides, perception of high
   prevalence and severity of AAT is likely to increase the willingness to
   pay for the herd-level technology. The findings emphasize the need for
   wider dissemination and commercialization of the tsetse repellent collar
   technology to reduce trypanosomosis transmission and hence enhance food
   security and farm incomes in the affected regions in Africa.},

Abstract = {Astronomy is considered by many to be a gateway science owing to its
   ability to inspire curiosity in everyone irrespective of age, culture,
   or general inclination towards science. Currently, where there is a
   global push to get more students engaged in Science, Technology,
   Engineering, and Mathematics, astronomy provides an invaluable conduit
   to achieve this shift. This paper highlights the results of a study
   which has reviewed the presence and extent to which astronomy has been
   incorporated into the school curriculum of the Organisation for Economic
   and Cooperative Development (OECD) member countries. In addition, two
   others strong in astronomy research, China and South Africa, are
   included together with the International Baccalaureate Diploma science
   curriculum. A total of 52 curricula from 37 countries were reviewed. The
   results reveal that astronomy and its related topics are prevalent in at
   least one grade in all curricula. Of the 52 curricula, 44 of them had
   astronomy-related topics in grade 6, 40 introduced astronomy-related
   topics in grade 1, whilst 14 had astronomy-related topics explicitly
   mentioned in all grades. At all year levels, celestial motion is the
   dominant content area; however, topics such as stars, physics,
   cosmology, and planetary science become much more frequent as a
   proportion towards the higher year levels. The most common keywords
   employed in the curricula related to basic astronomy concepts were the
   Earth, Sun, Moon, and stars, all with a high frequency of use. There is
   hardly any focus on Indigenous Astronomy or the role of prominent women
   astronomers. Relational textual analysis using Leximancer revealed that
   all the major concepts could be encompassed within two broad themes:
   Earth and Physics. Astronomy and Physics are often seen as different
   domains, with astronomy content being more facts based, than based on
   concepts.},

Abstract = {This Edition of the Journal comprise eleven papers, of which six are
   related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The papers are balanced between those
   mainly concerned with media or online pedagogies (four), staff
   development and experiences (three) and strategic university wide policy
   or institutional change (four). The papers continue to reflect a varied
   range of participant countries both in terms of the authors, but perhaps
   more importantly the study sites, (Colombia, Italy, Indonesia, Iran,
   Lebanon, South Africa, Spain, and Turkey). Universities from both the
   state and private sector are represented, either through individual case
   studies or via multi-site studies in subject areas, departments, or
   institutions.What is fascinating, and perhaps unsurprising, is that
   common themes emerge from different countries. From the papers in this
   edition, several issues emerge. First, we can conclude that with
   distance learning there was/is a particular challenge of dealing with
   cheating and plagiarism-and exhibited during the pandemic. Second,
   responses, or readiness to change, with respect to new initiatives and
   pedagogies can vary by discipline within the same institution, between
   institutions and within a country. Third, it was noted that when change
   is made, either planned or in an emergency, the extent of the impact is
   related to the prior experience and expertise of both teachers and
   students and the available infrastructure with respect to the new
   situation. Several papers raised concerns about the pedagogical
   competences of the teaching staff and how, when this is limited in
   relation to a required change in pedagogy, stress and workload problems
   are encountered by both teachers and students. Furthermore, the learning
   experience is hindered and, where technology changes are involved,
   students can become isolated and demotivated. Accessibility and equality
   e.g. (gender, age, income, access to resources) issues were also raised,
   most evident during the pandemic and emergency remote teaching. The
   conclusion is perhaps that universities need to plan more carefully for
   emergency situations taking account of their demographic and
   socio-economic community - whether teachers, students or other
   stakeholders.},

Title = {Catastrophic payment for assisted reproduction techniques with
   conventional ovarian stimulation in the public health sector of South
   Africa: frequency and coping strategies},

Abstract = {How often does out-of-pocket payment (OPP) for assisted reproduction
   techniques (ART) with conventional ovarian stimulation result in
   catastrophic expenditure for households?
   Catastrophic cost was a frequent event affecting 51 of the poorest study
   participants and one in five couples in total.
   There is increasing concern about catastrophic spending on health by
   households in low resource settings, but to date no study has evaluated
   OPP for ART.
   We conducted a prospective observational study comprising 135 couples
   undergoing ART between March 2009 and June 2011.
   The study was set at an urban, level 3 referral hospital in the public
   and academic health sector of South Africa. At this institution ART is
   subsidized but requires co-payment by patients. Couples undergoing ART
   with conventional ovarian stimulation using GnRH analogs were recruited.
   A questionnaire capturing information on socioeconomic status, monthly
   household expenditure, OPP for the index ART cycle and financial coping
   strategies was administered. Households were categorized into tertiles
   according to socio-economic status. In addition to descriptive
   statistics, annualized OPP for ART services as a percentage of annual
   non-food household expenditure was calculated to estimate catastrophic
   health care expenditure. The Pearson (2) test and a logistic regression
   were used to identify factors related to incurring catastrophic
   spending.
   In total, one in five couples (22) incurred catastrophic expenditure (P
   0.01), defined as an OPP of 40 of annual non-food expenditure.
   Households used a range of coping strategies including reduced
   expenditure on items such as clothing and food, use of savings,
   borrowing money and taking on extra work. Differences were observed
   between the socio-economic tertiles: in the poorest tertile, 51 of
   households faced catastrophic costs compared with only 2 of the richest
   tertile (P 0.01). Participants in the poorest tertile were more likely
   to be black (P 0.01), and less likely to have health insurance (P 0.01)
   or female full-time employment (P 0.01). Longer duration of infertility
   was an additional risk factor for catastrophic payment (P 0.05).
   No attempt was made to obtain proof of any payment or expenditure, and
   all information collected relied on participants verbal account.
   This is the first study to document the frequency of catastrophic
   expenditure for ART using conventional ovarian stimulation in a low
   resource setting. Our results show that not all couples unable to afford
   treatment forfeit infertility care; instead poor couples are willing to
   suffer catastrophic financial hardship in order to pay. ART counselling
   therefore needs to include financial risk counselling in the short term.
   Long-term interventions comprise cost-reducing strategies as well as
   health systems strategies that reduce or eliminate the need for OPP for
   ART wherever possible. Robust evidence on mild versus conventional
   stimulation for ART in low resource settings is also required in the
   form of local RCTs which address the many clinical and health economic
   variables and exclude bias. Our data cannot be extrapolated to patients
   undergoing ART elsewhere or to patients undergoing ART with mild ovarian
   stimulation.
   This study was funded by the Medical Research Council of South Africa
   and the University of Cape Town (University Research Committee and

Abstract = {The objective of the study was to outline the determinants of market
   awareness and participation in the Kaonafatso ya Dikgomo (KyD) scheme in
   South Africa. The study utilised a cross-sectional survey of a randomly
   selected sample of 116 KyD farmers in KwaZulu-Natal Province. A Logit
   model was used to analyse the data. The results show that more farmers
   are aware of farmgate market channels, but however, they tended to
   utilise auction market channels. Furthermore, gender, marital status,
   educational level, employment status, farm income, source of income,
   herd size, labour and training were significant variables in the
   awareness and use of butcheries, auctions and farm gate markets. The
   study concludes that the scheme is particularly effective in influencing
   commercialisation through utilisation of more lucrative market channels
   such as auctions. Furthermore, socio-economic factors had a bearing on
   the awareness and use of marketing channels for smallholder farmers in
   the KyD scheme. Labour was particularly significant across butchery,
   auction and farm gate market channels. The study recommends that the
   scheme needs to improve awareness and use of market channels through
   utilisation of information platforms such as radio, television and
   direct communication though mobile phones. Furthermore, extension should
   assist farmers not only in awareness of markets, but also in the
   utilisation of those markets.},

Abstract = {A survey was conducted to identify management information sources and
   communication channels used by commercially oriented smallholder beef
   cattle producers (n = 62) in Limpopo province, South Africa. A total of
   62 commercially oriented smallholder farmers under the Limpopo
   Industrial Development Corporation-Nguni cattle project were interviewed
   using a structured questionnaire to collect data. Descriptive statistics
   were used to analyse data on farmers' demographic and farm
   characteristics, sources of information and communication channels used.
   A multinomial logistic regression model was used to evaluate factors
   that influenced farmers' choices of information sources and
   communications channels used. Findings show that government extension
   (53\% of the respondents) and other farmers (30\%) were the major
   sources of management information for the farmers. Based on the logistic
   regression results, the decision to choose government extension as the
   main source of information was mainly influenced by respondents' gender
   (p = 0.001) and access to training (p = 0.023). Communication was mainly
   through farm-to-farm visits (56\%) and the use of mobile phones (30\%).
   Based on the current findings, the infusion of modern information
   communication technologies such as mobile phone-based innovations with
   the existing government extension service could further strengthen the
   capacity of farmers to share information among themselves as well as
   providing feedback to extension agents. Furthermore, it is essential to
   take cognizance of farmers' socio-economic factors when identifying and
   characterizing their management information sources and communication
   strategies.},

Abstract = {Solar photovoltaic (PV) production in Africa and Latin America combined
   comprise less than 3\% of the total global photovoltaic energy
   production in spite of the solar resources located across these regions.
   However, increased solar PV modularity, reduced costs of both large
   utility-scale and smaller residential-scale systems, limited operation
   and maintenance costs, and conversion efficiencies independent of power
   capacities is expected to contribute to future broader scale PV adoption
   in both Africa and Latin America. Reported prices of PV systems vary
   widely and depend on many factors including system size, location,
   customer type, connection to an electricity grid and technical
   specifications. In this chapter it is shown that while PV capacity in
   Africa and Latin America is far below many other global regions, there
   are some countries experiencing rapid growth, and that other nations are
   investing in solar supply chain capabilities. The low cost of the
   simplest solar-powered lamps produce savings on kerosene that makes them
   a smart investment. Also, solar-powered pumps are cost-effective,
   reliable, and can save many hours of labour daily in rural off-grid
   areas, where water hauling is traditionally done by hand by women and
   children. These pumps are durable and immune to fuel shortages needed
   for conventional pumping systems, and they may cost less than
   diesel-powered generators in many African and Latin American areas. In
   conclusion, PV is growing rapdily in many African and Latin American
   countries because of its modularity and drop in costs, offering a
   hopeful future not only to many countries that need affordable
   electricity to grow, but also for small rural communities that would
   like to be connected to the global community.},

Abstract = {Clinical History
   Patient: A 44-year-old, African-American female with sickle cell disease
   (SCD) presented for evaluation of pulmonary hypertension.
   Past Medical History: Sickle cell disease, pulmonary hypertension,
   hepatitis C (genotype 2), iron overload secondary to transfusion,
   hypothyroidism, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-alloimmunization due
   to multiple blood product transfusions for a simple transfusion every 3
   weeks.
   Past Immunohematology History: Patient's RBCs phenotyped as group A, Rh
   positive, C-E+c+e+, K:-1, Fy(a(-b-)), Jk((a+b-)), and S-s+. Red blood
   units transfused were ABO-compatible and negative for C and K antigens
   as per hospital policy to transfuse Rh- and K-matched RBC to patients
   with SCD. One month later, anti-Swain-Langley (SIa) was identified
   (Figure 1). This antibody is considered clinically insignificant and
   reactivity was observed when testing with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and
   low ionic-strength saline (LISS) showed <1+ reactivity with all cells
   tested except for the SIa antigen negative red cell. SIa is an antigen
   in the Knops blood group system and is destroyed by 0.2 M dithiothreitol
   (DTT). This technique was used, and the chemically-treated cells were
   used to rule out additional antibodies. Care must be taken when
   performing rule outs using 0.2 M OTT-treated cells because antigens
   other than SIa are destroyed. Antigens usually denatured or altered
   include Yt(a), JMH, Knops, LW, Kell, Lutheran, Dombrock, and Cromer
   blood group antigens.' The patient remained on C and K antigen negative
   restrictions and received units that were crossmatch-incompatible due to
   the anti-SIa. Approximately 3 years later, an antibody screen was
   performed (Figure 2), and anti-S was suspected. Additional testing
   confirmed the new antibody. After the identification of anti-S the
   patient was restricted to receive phenotypically-matched
   (ABO/Rh-compatible, C, K1, Fy(a), Jk(b) and S negative) RBC units. It
   was decided not to give units negative for the Fy(b) antigen since it is
   common for Africans who phenotype as Fy((a-b-)) to carry a variant Fyb
   allele, which carries a mutation within a GATA consensus sequence
   preventing expression of the gene in the erythroid cells but not other
   cells.(2)
   Physical Exam
   Vitals: Temperature was 36.7 degrees C, heart rate was 70 bpm, blood
   pressure was 119/74, weight was 84.1 kg, 02 saturation was 95\%, and
   room air=yes.
   General: No acute distress, interactive.
   Head/Eyes/Ears/Nose/Throat (HEENT): Normocephalic, pupils equal, round
   and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact, mouth without
   erythema, lesions, or exudates, no jugular venous distention, and no
   carotid bruits.
   Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no rates, rhonchi, or
   wheezing, good aeration.
   Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm.
   Extremities: No edema, no cyanosis, 1+ digital clubbing.
   Current Immunohematology Findings: Patient continued to receive
   phenotypically matched RBC units. Tie most recent sample indicates a
   third antibody is present. Reactivity with 2 S-negative cells was noted
   to be 3+, while all other S negative, SIa positive cells were 1+ in PEG
   and LISS (Figure 3). Two Jsa positive cells (2 and 8), reacted 3+ with
   patient plasma in both PEG arid LISS, yet no reactivity was observed
   with DTT-treated cells. Anti-Jsa was suspected and confirmed.},

Abstract = {The Carnegie Foundation has reported that most recipients of the PhD are
   inadequately prepared for the settings in which they will work; that
   women and ethnic minorities are inadequately represented; and that
   program attrition often exceeds 50\%. In 2002 Antioch University
   inaugurated a PhD in Leadership \& Change, with a vision of doctoral
   study that would be both highly innovative and grounded in research on
   student learning. The program has been acclaimed as ``groundbreaking{''}
   and ``a model for other universities in the United States and
   abroad.{''} The purpose of the session is to share the Antioch
   experiment and to suggest how the Antioch model might be applied to
   other doctoral programs.
   The program was designed for experienced professionals who are leading
   change in their respective fields of practice. Traditional ``courses{''}
   have been replaced by structured ``learning achievements{''} which
   students accomplish at their own pace. Students enter the program in
   cohorts of approximately 25-30, attracted - to date - from 27 states and
   Canada, and countries in the Caribbean, Europe, Africa, and Asia.
   Cohorts have highly diverse backgrounds, with approximately equal
   proportions of students from education, business, and nonprofits and
   government. Many are also from the arts. The program is an example of
   ``blended{''} learning, with four face-to-face residencies per year,
   attended by all faculty and students, and technology-mediated distance
   learning in between. The program culminates with a traditional
   dissertation. Approximately 135 students are actively enrolled in the
   program, and it has 63 alumni.
   An external program review in 2010 demonstrated that the program has
   addressed successfully each of the criticisms contained in the Carnegie
   report. 1) Because the program is practice-based, students learn to make
   meaning of practice and to become scholars of leadership and
   organizational change. Our students' dissertations are downloaded more
   than 1500 times per month by scholars and practitioners from all over
   the world; four have won international awards. 2) Not only do our
   students hail from a wide variety of professional settings, the student
   body is also highly diverse demographically: more than half of our
   students are women, and nearly 40\% are persons of color. This
   extraordinary diversity creates an environment that promotes a level of
   collaborative learning that is rare in doctoral study. 3) Unlike
   traditional doctoral curricula, retention is high: nearly 75\% of
   entering students earn their PhDs in six years or fewer. Two factors
   account for this. First, learning experiences are structured so that
   each builds on the others, thus generating a strong sense of momentum.
   Second, the program relies on strong personal support by cohort members
   and faculty advisors. This combination of an integrated curriculum and
   group cohesiveness help allay the ``imposter syndrome{''} that has
   plagued doctoral students for generations.
   Several qualities of the Antioch PhD deserve emulation by other doctoral
   programs both in the US and abroad: a culture of collaborative learning;
   library support services customized for each student; proactive advising
   by faculty and detailed feedback on student work; and a pervasive
   culture of continuous improvement - clear learning outcomes, detailed
   assessment, periodic critical reflection by faculty, and consistent use
   of assessment data to improve practice.},

Abstract = {Teleosts lack a hypophyseal portal system and hence neurohormones are
   carried by nerve fibers from the preoptic region to the pituitary. The
   various cell types in the teleost pituitary are organized in discrete
   domains. Fish possess two gonadotropins (GtH) similar to FSH and LH in
   other vertebrates; they are heterodimeric hormones that consist of a
   common alpha subunit non-covalently associated with a hormone-specific
   beta subunit. In recent years the availability of molecular cloning
   techniques allowed the isolation of the genes coding for the GtH
   subunits in 56 fish species representing at least 14 teleost orders.
   Advanced molecular engineering provides the technology to produce
   recombinant GtHs from isolated cDNAs. Various expression systems have
   been used for the production of recombinant proteins. Recombinant fish
   GtHs were produced for carp, seabream, channel and African catfish,
   goldfish, eel, tilapia, zebrafish, Manchurian trout and Orange-spotted
   grouper.
   The hypothalamus in fishes exerts its regulation on the release of the
   GtHs via several neurohormones such as GnRH, dopamine, GABA, PACAP,
   IGF-I, norepinephrine, NPY, kisspeptin, leptin and ghrelin. In addition,
   gonadal steroids and peptides exert their effects on the gonadotropins
   either directly or via the hypothalamus. All these are discussed in
   detail in this review.
   In mammals, the biological activities of FSH and LH are directed to
   different gonadal target cells through the cell-specific expression of
   the FSH receptor (FSHR) and LH receptor (LHR), respectively, and the
   interaction between each gonadotropin-receptor couple is highly
   selective. In contrast, the bioactivity of fish gonadotropins seems to
   be less specific as a result of promiscuous hormone-receptor
   interactions, while FSHR expression in Leydig cells explains the strong
   steroidogenic activity of FSH in certain fish species. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) has gained traction as one of the
   effective strategies in tackling the climate crisis. Many CSA practices
   have been promoted by development agencies to smallholder farmers based
   on the assumption that farmers would adopt these innovations for their
   potential benefits. However, the adoption of CSA practices in Ghana and
   much of Africa remains low and decision making and on-farm innovation
   processes are poorly understood. This study seeks to provide empirical
   and participatory insight into how smallholder farmers innovate. Based
   on a novel application of a participatory video methodology, in farming
   communities in the Upper West Region of Ghana, that have been exposed to
   multiple CSA intervention programmes, the paper analyses farmers' own
   self-curated accounts of experiences with CSA innovation. The findings
   show that farmer's motivation to adopt CSA innovations is driven by
   their concerns for food security, economic gains, and the environmental
   impact of climate change on their farming activities and livelihood. The
   study reveals a mismatch between the CSA technologies and practices
   advanced by the development agencies and what farmers perceive as
   relevant and important in addressing their farming challenges. In
   particular, the findings show that in a pool of more than 12 CSA
   technologies and practices that had been promoted through three
   donor-driven intervention programmes in the communities, farmers
   selected less labour intensive, less costly, and CSA technologies and
   practices that fitted to their current farming practices and the local
   context. Agricultural extension agents served as an important
   information source on the CSA innovation and their practical
   implementation and farmers' social groups played a crucial role in
   facilitating learning about the CSA technologies and practices. There is
   the need to integrate farmers voices using innovative methodologies such
   as participatory videos to better understand farmers' experiences in the
   innovation process which will help inform the design of effective
   interventions and promote adoption of innovations aimed at enhancing the
   productivity of smallholder farmers and reducing environmental impacts
   in African food systems. By focusing on the innovations that farmers
   perceive as beneficial and adaptable to their local contexts,
   development organizations can use their resources more efficiently and
   promote adoption of contextually appropriate CSA innovations.},

   management in smallholder inland-valley rice-based systems in West

Abstract = {In West Africa, weeds are major production constraints in rain-fed
   lowland rice systems-often located in the inland valleys. Weed
   management technologies have been developed and promoted in such rice
   systems, but adoption by farmers lags behind, probably because of
   insufficient considerations of the system diversity or the farm-specific
   characteristics during technology development or promotion. This study
   aimed to identify farm-type specific entry points for innovations in
   weed management practices of smallholders in rice-based systems in
   inland valleys. We conducted farm surveys in the Mono Couffo region of
   Benin in 66 fields in 2010 and 2011 in a range of socio-economic
   settings typical for smallholder farms. We would strongly propose to
   move `in the Mono Couffo region of Benin' from the end of the sentence
   to the beginning, right after `We conducted farm surveys'. This way, we
   do not give the impression that the smallholder farms we surveyed are
   necessarily only typical for the Mono Couffo region. In fact we chose
   this site as it was considered to be representative for lowland
   rice-based production systems in West Africa, as we argue in the
   Materials and Methods. In the title we also refer to `West Africa', not
   Benin. A combination of multivariate analyses using Principal Component
   Analysis and Agglomerative Hierarchical Cluster is helpful in
   constructing farm typologies. This categorization, in turn, enables the
   assessment of farm-type specific weed management strategies and
   consequently the identification of entry points for innovation. Specific
   entry points for innovations in weed management include: (i)
   complementing the existing range of curative options by more preventive
   measures, (ii) diversifying the existing range of curative measures
   (mainly hand weeding and herbicide application) by measures that are
   both non-chemical and labor-saving, and (iii) improving women farmers'
   access to information and inputs by targeted training endeavors and
   conducive credit systems.},

Title = {Compliance towards WHO recommendations on antenatal care for a positive
   pregnancy experience: Timeliness and adequacy of antenatal care visit in
   Sub-Saharan African countries: Evidence from the most recent standard
   Demographic Health Survey data},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {Background Timely and adequate antenatal care (ANC) visits are known to
   reduce maternal mortality by 20\%. Despite the World Health Organization
   updating its recommendations from four to eight antenatal care contacts,
   data reporting in the SSA region focused primarily on four visits, and
   evidence on the timing and adequacy of ANC based on the current
   recommendation was limited. Hence, this study aimed at assessing the
   level of timely and adequate ANC visits and their determinants in the 18
   Sub-Saharan African countries with the most recent DHS report
   (2016-2021).Methods The data for this study were pooled from the most
   recent standardized Demographic and Health Survey data of sub-Saharan
   African countries from 2016-2021. A total of 171,183 (with a weighted
   frequency of 171,488) women were included and analyzed by using STATA
   version 16. To account for data clustering, a multivariable multilevel
   mixed-effect logistic regression analysis was run to determine the
   effects of each predictor on the receipt of timely and adequate ANC.
   Adjusted odds ratio with its corresponding 95\% confidence interval was
   used to declare the statistical significance of the independent
   variables.Results The receipt of timely and adequate antenatal care
   visits was 41.2\% (95\% CI: 40.9, 41.4) and 10.4\% (95\% CI: 9.9, 10.2),
   respectively. Wontedness of pregnancy {[}AOR = 1.18; 95\% CI: 1.13,
   1.24], being 1st birth order {[}AOR = 1.48; 95\% CI: 1.41, 2.54], having
   a mobile phone {[}AOR = 1.49; 95\% CI: 1.26, 2.32], and enrolled in
   Health insurance schemes {[}AOR = 2.03; 95\% CI: 1.95, 2.42] were
   significantly associated with early initiation of ANC. Living in a lower
   community poverty level{[}AOR = 2.23; 95\% CI: 1.90,2.66], being in the
   richest wealth quintile {[}AOR = 1.49; 95\% CI: 1.36, 1.62], higher
   educational level {[}AOR = 3.63; 95\% CI: 3.33, 3.96], the timing of ANC
   visit {[}AOR = 4.26; 95\% CI: 4.08, 4.44], being autonomous in decision
   making {[}AOR = 2.29; 95\% CI: 1.83, 2.54] and having a mobile phone
   {[}AOR = 1.89; 95\% CI: 1.76, 2.52] were identified as significant
   predictors of adequate ANC uptake.Conclusion The findings revealed a low
   coverage of timely and adequate ANC visits in SSA countries. Governments
   and healthcare managers in sub-Saharan African countries should leverage
   their efforts to prioritize and implement activities and interventions
   that increase women's autonomy, and economic capability, to improve
   their health-seeking behavior during pregnancy. More commitment is
   needed from governments to increase mobile phone distribution across
   countries, and then work on integrating mHealth into their health
   system. Finally, efforts should be made to increase the coverage of
   health insurance schemes enrolment for the citizens.},

Abstract = {This article sets out from the underlying belief that soap operas, like
   many other forms of popular media, play a role in ordering and
   rearranging people's everyday life routines, and inquires into some of
   the ways a South African soap opera functions as a barometer and a
   vehicle of constancy and change in contemporary South Africa. Focusing
   specifically on the longstanding South African soap opera, Generations,
   the article assesses this soap opera as both a product of post-apartheid
   South Africa and as a mechanism which maintains, and promotes changes
   in, its viewers' preferences, beliefs and patterns of everyday life
   social behaviour. Following Robert Foster's argument on commercial
   technologies as conducive to constructing `national' or collective
   entities (Foster 1999: 266-69; 2002: 69), the soap opera is regarded
   here as a `commercial' technology through which a diversity of viewers
   are able to constitute a sense of themselves as sharing a wide range of
   discursive patterns, images, beliefs and lifestyle practices, even as it
   also motivates them towards social mobility, social action and social
   change.
   In terms of this themed issue's focus on cultural economy, the article
   further considers, albeit partially, the extent to which the production
   and consumption of Generations is driven by received political economic
   determinates (i.e. prescribed and shifting guidelines by the South
   African national broadcaster, the SABC, regarding how the popular media
   should be configured) which have themselves been transformed into a set
   of strategically managed socio-cultural determinants. The latter
   address, for instance, how the popular media in South Africa, and soap
   opera in particular, have been brought to bear on perceptions of
   individual selfhood and collective identity among consumers/viewers, and
   how socio-political change in South Africa is also reshaping
   representations of collective and individual aspirations of social
   mobility in popular media discourses and among the consumers thereof.
   Drawing on ethnographic television audience research, and a range of
   recent inquiries into South African soap opera by local scholars, I
   assess how the perceptions and viewing experiences of a group of young
   adult (female and male), black South African viewers of Generations
   interviewed for the present study, attest to some of the ways in which
   young adult South Africans are coping, through their viewing
   experiences, with the socio-cultural contradictions of South Africa's
   transforming society.},

Title = {Nodule crushing: a novel technique to decentralize rhizobia inoculant
   technology and empower small-scale farmers to enhance legume production
   and income},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {8},
Month = {AUG 29},
Abstract = {Millions of small scale legume farmers lack access to rhizobia bacterial
   inoculants that improve crop protein and yield, and minimize fossil-fuel
   based nitrogen fertilizers, through biological nitrogen fixation (BNF).
   BNF converts atmospheric nitrogen gas into ammonia, required to
   synthesize chlorophyll and amino acids. BNF is catalyzed by rhizobia
   that inhabit nodule organs in legume roots (e.g., soybean, cowpea,
   chickpeas, lentil, fava, peas, beans). Rhizobia inoculant access in
   remote communities is limited by centralized facilities to grow
   bacteria, inadequate transportation networks and refrigeration.
   Recently, we proposed that rhizobia inoculants can be diffused by
   farmers themselves, simply, by crushing nodules onto seeds, and
   demonstrated its efficacy under field conditions. A concern was whether
   nodules remain viable between growing seasons. Here we provide
   preliminary evidence that bean nodules, dried and stored at room
   temperature after 6 months, retain nodulation potential. We discuss: (1)
   the feasibility, constraints and risks of nodule crushing; (2) scaling
   up strategies; (3) entrepreneurship that benefits women farmers (e.g.,
   nodule-selling microenterprises); and (4) empowering farmers to directly
   select, evolve and indigenize rhizobia for the first time. Finally, we
   prioritize research questions and encourage the formation of a global
   participatory research network, with the goal of decentralizing and
   democratizing rhizobia inoculants.},

Abstract = {Objectives: To determine whether households that generate several 911
   calls differ in important ways from those that make a single call and to
   determine whether households that generate repeat 911 calls for intimate
   partner violence (IPV) experience more severe violence than those that
   do not. Methods: All cases of police-documented IPV were reviewed and
   linked with their respective 911 calls. Each incident report was
   reviewed to determine the relationship between the offender and victim,
   demographic characteristics of the offender and victim, weapon and
   substance involvement, prior incidents of IPV, and violence severity.
   Results: Of the 1,505 IPV addresses identified during the 12-month study
   interval, 1,010 (67.1\%) placed more than one phone call to report IPV
   Sixty-nine percent of African American victims, 50.6\% of white victims,
   and 36.8\% of Hispanic victims were repeat callers (p < 0.001). There
   were no differences between addresses that generated repeat calls versus
   single calls with respect to offender alcohol or drug involvement,
   presence of children, victim age, or offender age. Sixty-seven percent
   of households with severe violence and 66.9\% of households with minor
   violence generated repeat 911 calls (p = 0.98). Conclusions: Ethnic
   differences in 911 use for IPV exist between African Americans, whites,
   and Hispanics. However, unknown societal, economic, or cultural issues
   could have influenced this finding. Households that repeatedly contacted
   911 during the study interval to report IPV were not more likely to
   experience severe violence than those that placed a single 911 call.},

Title = {Circulating anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies, cytokines and
   genotype as biomarkers of response to disease-modifying antirheumatic
   drug therapy in early rheumatoid arthritis},
Journal = {BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {16},
Month = {MAY 29},
Abstract = {Background: To measure circulating anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies
   (ACPA) and cytokines pre- and 6 months post-therapy as a strategy to
   predict and optimize responses to traditional disease-modifying
   antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in early RA, which is an unmet need in
   developing countries.
   Patients and methods: A cohort of 140 predominantly (88.5 \%) black
   female South African patients with early RA was treated with synthetic
   DMARDs, mostly methotrexate (MTX) alone, or in combination with low dose
   oral corticosteroids (CS). Circulating ACPA and a panel of circulating
   cytokines/chemokines/ growth factors were measured at baseline and after
   6 months of therapy in relation to disease activity and Shared Epitope
   (SE).
   Results: Following 6 months of therapy, the median simplified disease
   activity index (SDAI) declined from a baseline of 41.4 to 16.0 (p =
   0.0001) for the entire cohort, which was paralleled by significant falls
   in median serum ACPA levels (516.6 vs. 255.7 units/ml, p = < 0.0001) and
   several of the circulating cytokines (IL-4, IL-7, IL-8, G-CSF, VEGF; p <
   0.0010 - p < 0.0001) which were most evident in the subgroup of patients
   treated with a combination of MTX and CS. Although biomarker
   concentrations decreased most notably in the low-disease activity group
   post-therapy, no significant correlations between these biomarkers and
   disease activity were observed, Baseline ACPA levels, but not SDAI or
   cytokines, were significantly higher in the subgroup of risk
   allele-positive patients (561.1 vs. 331.9 units/ml, p < 0.05), while no
   associations with ACPA and a smoking history were evident.
   Conclusions: The use of DMARDs in RA is associated with significant
   decreases in ACPA and cytokines which did not correlate with changes in
   SDAI, precluding the utility of serial measurement of these biomarkers
   to monitor early responses to therapy, but may have prognostic value.},

Title = {Robot-assisted tumorectomy for an unusual pelvic retroperitoneal
   leiomyoma: A case report},
Journal = {MEDICINE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {101},

Month = {AUG 5},
Abstract = {Rationale: Extrauterine leiomyoma occasionally occurs in rare locations
   with unusual growth patterns, especially pelvic retroperitoneal
   leiomyoma, which brings great challenges for surgeons to make a
   diagnosis. It is essential to distinguish benign from malignant
   retroperitoneal neoplasms according to the imaging manifestations.
   Laparotomy and laparoscopy are the common options for pelvic
   retroperitoneal neoplasms, while they may cause side effects during
   operation such as secondary damage. Appropriate surgical techniques
   should be adopted to ensure the complete excision of neoplasms meanwhile
   preserve the urination, defecation, and sexual function. Patient
   concerns: A 30-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of
   dull pain in the perianal region for 1 month. Laboratory results
   including tumor markers were all within normal limits. The digital
   rectal examination revealed a huge and tough mass with smooth mucosa
   protruding into the rectal cavity from the rear area of rectum.
   Diagnosis: Imaging examinations were performed. Contrasted computed
   tomography (CT) of pelvis showed an enhanced retroperitoneal solid mass
   in the space between sacrum and rectum, and very close to the levator
   ani muscle. The mass was about 11.0{*}8.0 cm in size. Computerized
   tomography angiography (CTA) showed the distal branches of bilateral
   internal iliac artery went into the mass. Endoscopic ultrasonography
   (US) showed the mass compressed the rectum, as well as a clear boundary
   to the rectal wall. A histopathologic examination confirmed the mass was
   a pelvic retroperitoneal leiomyoma. Interventions: The patient underwent
   an operative resection with da Vinci Si surgical system after routine
   preoperative preparation. Anorectal motility was weekly monitored
   postoperation. No additional adjuvant therapy was performed. Outcomes:
   The patient could walk after 1 day and defecate normally on the third
   day after operation. She was discharged on the seventh postoperative
   day. No adverse events including pelvic floor hernia or defecation
   dysfunction occurred in the follow-up period. At 4 weeks follow-up, the
   patient was pain-free and recovered well. Lessons: Although imaging
   examinations were crucial for retroperitoneal neoplasms,
   histopathological examination remains the ``gold standard{''} for making
   a definite diagnosis. This case highlights the possibility of
   retroperitoneal leiomyoma occurring in a woman of reproductive age and
   the advantages of robotic surgical system in pelvic retroperitoneal
   surgeries.},

Abstract = {While the impact of the pandemic has varied between and within
   countries, there are few published data on the relationship between
   social determinants of health (SDoH) and COVID-19 in Africa. This
   ecological cross-sectional study examines the relationship between
   COVID-19 risk and SDoH among 28 African countries. Included were
   countries with a recent demographic and health survey (years 2010 to
   2018). The response variables were COVID-19 case rates and death rates
   (reported as of 15 August 2020); and the covariates comprised eight
   broad topics common to multiple SDoH frameworks aggregated to the
   country level: geography (urban residence), wealth index, education,
   employment, crowding, and access to information. A negative binomial
   regression was used to assess the association between aspects of SDoH
   and COVID-19 outcomes. Our analysis indicated that 1 in 4 (25.1\%)
   households in study countries are without safe and clean water and a
   space for handwashing. The odds of COVID-19 morbidity and deaths were
   higher in countries with a high proportion of households without access
   to safe and clean water. Having a high proportional of educated women
   (1.003: 95\% CI, 1.001-1.005) and living in a less crowded home (0.959:
   95\% CI, 0.920-1.000) were negatively associated with COVID-19 deaths,
   while being insured and owning a mobile phone predicted illness.
   Overall, aspects of SDoH contribute either negatively or positively to
   COVID-19 outcomes. Thus, addressing economic and environmental SDoH is
   critical for mitigating the spread of COVID-19 and re-emerging diseases
   on the African continent.},

Title = {HBV and HIV viral load but not microbial translocation or immune
   activation are associated with liver fibrosis among patients in South
   Africa},
Journal = {BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {MAY 8},
Abstract = {Background: Co-infection with HIV negatively impacts the progression of
   chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, including causing rapid
   progression to liver fibrosis. Sub-Saharan Africa represents arguably
   the most important intersection of high endemicity of both chronic
   hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and HIV infection.
   Methods: We recruited 46 HBV/HIV-co-infected; 47 HBV-monoinfected; 39
   HIV-monoinfected; and 37 HBV/HIV-uninfected patients from Tygerberg
   Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. All HIV-infected patients were on
   antiretroviral therapy for >= 3 months. Liver stiffness measurements
   were assessed using the Fibroscan (Fibroscan 402, Echosens). Cell-based
   immunomarkers were measured by flow cytometry. Soluble serum/plasma
   immunomarkers were measured by Luminex technology and enzyme
   immunoassays. HIV (COBAS/Ampliprep TaqMan HIV-1) and HBV viral loads
   (in-house assay) were also performed.
   Results: HBV/HIV co-infected patients showed significantly higher levels
   of immune activation \%CD8+/HLA-DR+/CD38+ (median 30\%, interquartile
   range: 17-53) and \%CD8+/PD-1 (median 22\%, interquartile range: 15-33),
   p <= 0.01 compared to all other study groups. Despite this, the
   HBV-mono-infected group had the highest proportion of patients with
   advanced liver fibrosis (>= 13 kPa) as measured by Fibroscan (18\%). HBV
   mono-infected patients showed highest expression of most cytokines
   including IL-17 and basic fibroblastic growth factor. There was
   significant positive correlation between detectable HIV and HBV viral
   replication and liver fibrosis but not immune activation or gut
   translocation.
   Discussion: Highly-active antiretroviral therapy, including tenofovir,
   is effective against both HIV and HBV. Earlier therapy in the
   co-infected patients may therefore have controlled viral replication
   leading to better fibrosis scores when compared to HBV mono-infection in
   this study. On-going HBV and HIV viraemia, rather than microbial
   translocation or immune activation, appear to be the drivers of liver
   fibrosis. Moderate to advanced liver fibrosis in HBV-mono-infection may
   well indicate poor access to screening and treatment of HBV infection.},

Title = {Assisted conception and placental perfusion assessed by uterine artery
   Doppler at 11-13 weeks' gestation},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pregnancies conceived by IVF are at increased risk of
   pre-eclampsia (PE). This study examines the potential mechanism for such
   association by examining the effect of method of conception on
   placentation as assessed by uterine artery Doppler at 11-13 weeks'
   gestation.
   METHODS: This prospective screening study at 11(+0)-13(+6) weeks for PE
   in singleton pregnancies used a combination of maternal history and
   uterine artery pulsatility index (PI). Regression analysis was performed
   to examine the association between the method of conception and both
   uterine artery PI and development of PE, after adjustment for maternal
   characteristics and obstetric history.
   RESULTS: In the study population of 27 461 pregnancies, conception was
   spontaneous in 26 538 (96.6\%), by IVF in 426 (1.6\%) and by use of
   ovulation induction (OI) drugs in 497 (1.8\%) pregnancies. Conception by
   IVF was associated with an increase in risk for early-PE, requiring
   delivery before 34 weeks {[}odds ratio 3.94, 95\% confidence interval
   (CI) 1.51-10.27] but not for late-PE. In the OI group, the risk of
   early- and late-PE was not increased. In addition to IVF, other
   significant contributors to the prediction of early-PE were maternal
   weight, height, African and South Asian racial origin, previous and
   family history of PE and history of chronic hypertension. Significant
   contributions in explaining log(10) uterine artery PI were provided from
   maternal characteristics but not from the method of conception. The
   median uterine artery PI multiple of the median (MoM) in the IVF group
   (1.02 MoM) and in the OI group (1.03 MoM) were not significantly
   different from that of the spontaneous conception group (1.01 MoM; P =
   0.870 and P = 0.296, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: Conception by IVF substantially increases the risk for
   early-PE, through a mechanism unrelated to clinically measurable
   impairment in placental perfusion.},

Abstract = {Integrated Agricultural Research for Development (IAR4D) is a mode of
   participatory action research for development that aims to improve the
   well-being of smallholder farming households by facilitating networks
   between farmers and marketplace actors through groups called `innovation
   platforms'. In 2012, the Association for the Promotion of Livestock in
   the Sahel and Savannas (APESS, an NGO with rural membership) established
   nine innovation platforms in the Sahelian zone in Senegal, Burkina Faso,
   Cameroon and Chad, with the aim of engaging member livestock producers
   with meat and milk processors and traders. In late 2013 and early 2014,
   each innovation platform reviewed its perception of ``performance{''} or
   ``functionality{''}, using a consensus-based group assessment scored
   against nine criteria. The aim of this study is to test the extent to
   which perceived functionality was related to the activities of the
   innovation platform, as well as current farm productivity and
   profitability, household well-being, and regional context, using data
   gathered independently by APESS as part of its broader mandate to
   improve the lives of members.
   Across the nine innovation platforms, there were strong positive
   correlations between the responses to all self assessment criteria i.e.
   members perceived that their innovation platform was performing strongly
   or weakly in all respects. The criterion scores were correlated
   positively with the number of meetings held, but not with numbers or
   gender of attendees, training opportunities, nor actions agreed at
   meetings. Innovation platforms self-assessed more positively in
   southern, higher rainfall regions than in the northern, lower rainfall
   regions. Performance was positively correlated with many measures of
   farm productivity and household well-being, including median area of
   farms, value of crop and hay production, sales of animals or animal
   products, expenditure on agricultural inputs, current engagement with
   markets, and estimated number of months per year that the family is able
   to feed itself.
   We conclude that the IAR4D approach is perceived to work well in high
   rainfall zones, for smallholders with a relatively high current level of
   well-being, who have larger and more productive farms, and who are
   already engaged with markets. The approach does not appear to work well
   in more arid regions for poorer smallholders, who are often not able to
   provide food for their families for 12 months of every year. The IAR4D
   focus on social networking into markets appears to be relevant for
   producers who wish to strengthen or diversify existing market
   relationships, but is not perceived to be sufficiently relevant by
   smallholders for whom achieving reliable subsistence and averting
   starvation remains the priority.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially affected the lives of young
   people living in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), leading to poorer short-term
   mental health outcomes. However, longitudinal data investigating changes
   in mental health from pre-COVID levels and their predictors are lacking.
   Our longitudinal sample comprised N = 233 young people (mean age: 17.8
   years at baseline, 55.6\% female) living in a deprived neighbourhood
   near Cape Town, South Africa. Symptoms of depression (PHQ-9), anxiety
   (GAD-7) and alcohol use (AUDIT) were assessed during two waves of data
   collection, pre-pandemic (2018/19) and via phone interviews in June to
   October 2020, during South Africa's first COVID wave and subsequent case
   decline. Latent change score models were used to investigate predictors
   of changes in mental health. Controlling for baseline levels, we found
   increases in depression and anxiety but not alcohol use symptoms during
   the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher baseline symptoms were associated with
   smaller increases on all measures. Socio-economic deprivation (lack of
   household income, food insecurity) before and during COVID were
   associated with higher anxiety and depression symptom increases. Having
   had more positive experiences during COVID was associated with lower
   post-COVID onset anxiety and depression increases, and marginally with
   less alcohol use, while negative experiences (household arguments,
   worries) were linked to stronger symptom increases. Overall, in a sample
   of young people from an adverse environment in South Africa, we found
   increased mental health difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic,
   though higher baseline symptoms did not necessarily predict stronger
   increases. Several factors pre- and post-COVID onset were identified
   that could be relevant for determining risk and resilience. In the long
   term, it will be key to address these structural drivers of well-being
   and to ensure mental health needs of young people are being met to
   support SSA countries in building back successfully from COVID-19 and
   preparing for future shock events.},

   only 5-10\% of cultivated land is planted with improved seeds, and about
   10\% of rural farmers use improved varieties. The objective of this
   investigation was to identify determinants of adoption of improved seed
   by farmers not participating in and those participating in the federal
   government's e-wallet program in Nigeria. We determined the impact of
   the e-wallet program on adoption of improved seed in rural areas. A
   total of 1200 rural farmers were sampled across six geopolitical zones
   of Nigeria. Results from the use of a bivariate probit model indicated
   that the e-wallet program continued to become increasingly popular among
   rural farmers; and that farmers' literacy, ownership of a mobile phone,
   value output, mobile network coverage, power for charging phone
   batteries and contact with extension agents were the positive
   determinants of farmer participation in the e-wallet program. Cultural
   obstacles to married women, growers' age, and increased distance to
   registration and input collection centers reduced farmers' tendency to
   participate in the e-wallet program. The results also showed that rural
   farmers depended on the e-wallet program for increased use and adoption
   of improved seed in Nigeria, to boost food security in sub-Saharan
   Africa. The results suggested the need for an improved e-wallet model by
   lessening constraints mostly associated with rural information and
   communication infrastructure, and distance to the registration and input
   collection centers.},

Abstract = {Teachers' assessment literacy is one of the most significant
   competencies and capabilities in education. South Africa has experienced
   several curriculum changes in past years, which the latest Curriculum
   and Assessment Policy Statement (CAPS) attests to. Curriculum changes
   make it difficult for teachers to adjust their assessment practices.
   Assessment is accepted as an integral part of learning and should be
   planned and conducted in a constructive way and not as an add-on to
   teaching and learning.
   Professional development for teaching includes a strong component of the
   theory and practice of assessment, and teachers are expected to make
   this component part of their pedagogical knowledge and to apply it.
   Assessment practices are shaped by teachers' faith in their teaching
   capabilities.
   In this article we focused on the experiences and the knowledge of
   teachers who have completed a programme for the Postgraduate Certificate
   in Education (PGCE) at a distance teaching institution and who have been
   teaching for at least five years. The aim of this study was to
   scrutinise assessment practices using Bereiter's conception of knowledge
   building as a theoretical framework. This perspective works on the
   assumption that teacher knowledge grows and adapts constantly through
   teaching practice. Such knowledge contributes to shared knowledge in the
   profession and the teaching community. In this way, knowledge is built
   in a community of practice where participants draw on their personal
   epistemologies to share and enhance pedagogical knowledge. Bereiter's
   framework of knowledge building is used in this study to gain a greater
   understanding of professional preparation in general, covering the full
   range of curriculum practices, including assessment. Professional
   preparation of assessment practices is seen as a form of situated
   learning and a constructive process that blends theory and practice.
   Knowledge of different methods of assessment is required and ought to be
   covered in professional preparation programmes such as the PGCE. Teacher
   knowledge about assessment should include knowledge about the importance
   of feedback. Without timely and constructive feedback, learners cannot
   meet course outcomes.
   A total of 20 teachers were purposefully selected and 14 volunteered to
   participate in the research. The ages of the five male and nine female
   participants ranged between 26 and 54 years. Each of the participants
   had at least five years of teaching experience. The qualitative data
   were supported by additional information collected by means of
   open-ended questions to determine the participants' views on good
   assessment practices, the role of feedback and actions that can be taken
   to optimise learning. All ethical requirements were adhered to. Thematic
   coding and analysis were carried out to guard against bias and to ensure
   trustworthiness.
   The findings indicate, among other things, that teachers do not lack
   confidence but need more assistance with professional growth in respect
   of classroom-based assessment. The need for training in assessment tools
   such as rubrics and the use of technology and taxonomies was
   highlighted. The need for assistance from school management teams to
   enable teachers to implement an assessment plan was also emphasised.
   Furthermore, it was suggested that teachers undergo extended teaching
   practice to prepare them for reality.
   It is important for policymakers and teacher training institutions to
   have a better understanding of the what and how of professional
   knowledge building regarding assessment in the classroom.
   In the light of the research results, it is recommended that preparation
   by means of a PGCE programme should have explicitly stated purposes to
   guide assessment and should include lecture videos on the use of
   taxonomies, rubrics and technology. Teacher training should be holistic
   if it is to produce all-round, reflective practitioners who can advance
   learning in schools.},

Title = {Telephone delivered interventions for preventing HIV infection in
   HIV-negative persons},
Journal = {COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS},
Year = {2013},
Number = {5},
Abstract = {Background
   This is one of the three Cochrane reviews that examine the role of the
   telephone in HIV/AIDS services. Although HIV infection can be prevented,
   still a large number of new infections occur. More effective HIV
   prevention interventions are needed to reduce the number of people newly
   infected with HIV. Phone calls can be used to potentially more
   effectively deliver HIV prevention interventions. They have the
   potential to save time, reduce costs and facilitate easier access.
   Objectives
   To assess the effectiveness of voice landline and mobile telephone
   delivered HIV prevention interventions in HIV-negative persons.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE,
   PubMed Central, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to
   Nursing \& Allied Health, the World Health Organization's Global Health
   Library and Current Controlled Trials from 1980 to June 2011. We
   searched the following grey literature sources: Dissertation Abstracts
   International and the Centre for Agricultural Bioscience International
   Direct Global Health database, the System for Information on Grey
   Literature Europe, The Healthcare Management Information Consortium,
   Google Scholar, Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections
   database, International AIDS Society conference database, AIDS Education
   Global Information System and reference lists of articles.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised controlled trials,
   controlled before and after studies, and interrupted time series studies
   comparing the effectiveness of delivering HIV prevention by phone calls
   to usual care in HIV-negative people regardless of their demographic
   characteristics and in all settings.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two reviewers independently searched databases, screened citations,
   assessed study quality and extracted data. A third reviewer resolved any
   disagreement. Primary outcomes were knowledge about the causes and
   consequences of HIV/AIDS, change in behaviour, healthcare uptake and
   clinical outcomes. Secondary outcomes were users' and providers' views
   on the intervention, economic outcomes and adverse outcomes.
   Main results
   Out of 14,717 citations, only one study met the inclusion criteria. The
   included RCT recruited women and girl children who received
   post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) after rape from sexual assault services
   in South Africa between August 2007 and May 2008.
   Participants (n (number) = 274) were randomised into a telephone support
   (n=136) and control (n=138) group. Control group participants received
   usual care (an interactive information session) from the sexual assault
   service during the 28 days in which they had to take PEP, with no
   further contact from the study staff. Telephone support group
   participants received standard care and phone calls from a counsellor
   throughout the 28 days when they had to take PEP.
   Overall, adherence to PEP was not significantly (P=0.13) different
   between the intervention (38.2\%) and control (31.9\%) groups. Also, the
   proportion of participants who read a pamphlet, did not return to
   collect medication or with a depression were not significantly different
   between the intervention and control groups (P=0.006, P=0.42, P=0.72
   respectively). The proportion of participants who used a diary was
   significantly (P=0.001) higher in the intervention group (78.8\%) versus
   the control group (69.9\%). The study authors reported that there were
   no recorded adverse events. The RCT did not provide information about
   participants' and providers' evaluation outcomes, or economic outcomes.
   The study had a moderate risk of bias.
   Authors' conclusions
   We found only one RCT, with a moderate risk of bias, which showed that
   providing PEP support by phone calls did not result in higher adherence
   to PEP. However, the RCT was conducted in an upper-middle-income country
   with high HIV prevalence, on a high-risk population and the
   applicability of its results on other settings and contexts is unclear.
   There is a need for robust evidence from various settings on the
   effectiveness of using phone calls for providing PEP support and for
   other HIV prevention interventions.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic that has ravaged the world since December 2019
   caused disruptions in the engineering education sector as students in
   African universities were unable to learn virtually. From two recent
   multi-language, multi-cultural pan-African online surveys to assess the
   impact on students, over 6,000 responses showed the twin constraints of
   irregular electric power supply and poor internet connectivity to
   effectively participate in virtual learning. This project is aimed at
   developing an affordable and reliable power and communication device for
   continuous online learning for engineering students, showcasing the
   strength in Africa's diversity through a collaborative, multinational,
   multicultural, multi-lingual and gender-sensitive platform to solve this
   identified global African Engineering Education challenge. A collapsible
   100-watt solar photovoltaic module charging a set of lithium batteries
   via the charge controller was used to power a laptop computer, a mobile
   phone and a 5-watts bulb simultaneously through a Direct Current/Direct
   Current (DC/DC) converter. An embedded modem in the device provided the
   wireless network for internet connectivity. The initial prototypes
   produced weighed less than 7 kg, and preliminary performance tests
   showed that the gadget was able to charge up a laptop and two
   smartphones totaling 45.5WH from 0\% to 100\% while the remaining
   backpack state of charge remains 12.8V at 88\% (that is 12\% depth of
   discharge). The power supply and communication device for continuous
   online learning for African engineering students will not only bring
   engineering solution collaboration among hundreds of engineers,
   technologists, and technicians from the entire African continent, but
   will also boost entrepreneurial skills for many African engineering
   practitioners when fully commercialised.},

Abstract = {It cannot be denied that the university is a place of refuge, and it
   cannot be accepted that the university is a place of enlightment. (Moten
   and Harney, 2009: 145)
   Nothing About Us Without Us! (Charlton, 2000)
   Universities have a long history. The mantra of the universitas - `the
   whole, the universe, the world' - has moved thinkers across the
   centuries: the university of al-Qarawiyyin, in Fez, Morocco, was founded
   in 859 followed by Al-Azhar University, in Cairo, Egypt, in 972. The
   first in Europe, the University of Bologna (the oldest university still
   in existence), opened its doors in 1088. In 1636, Harvard University
   became the first university in the United States.
   In The History of American Higher Education, Roger Geiger (2014)
   demonstrates how in the context of the United States, universities have
   evolved over ten or eleven generations from the religious college with a
   classical curriculum in the seventeenth century to the contemporary
   research university. These changes were motivated in large part by
   Thomas Jefferson's vision of education as an instrument of democracy, `a
   vision that gained momentum with the profusion of state universities in
   the nineteenth century, spurred by policies like the Morrill Land-Grant
   acts, and that reached its peak in the postwar era thanks to substantial
   federal and state support' (Williams, 2016).
   In The University in Ruins, Bill Readings wonders whether universities
   have outlived their purpose as the safeguard of national culture whose
   promise it is to create tradition, to found mythologies, to form a
   Subject of knowledge. Is the university in the twilight of its social
   function? he asks (1997: 5).
   The Subject of knowledge at the heart of the university's social
   function has historically been a privileged, male subject. From the
   earlier religious universities to the secular ones of our contemporary
   times, knowledge has been mediated by that all-seeing universalizing
   gaze. Centuries of university education took place before women were
   consistently admitted to the university: in the United States, it took
   more than 200 years until the first woman graduated in 1849, a period in
   which African Americans were still generally denied higher education.
   Indeed, prior to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, most colleges and
   universities in the Southern United States prohibited African Americans
   from attending.
   Though Gallaudet, a US college for the Deaf, was founded in 1864,
   successful accommodations for disabled scholars remain few and far
   between in the university (Garberoglio, Cawthon and Sales, 2017). The
   situation for the DeafBlind is even more dire: an astonishing number of
   DeafBlind students leave the university before completing their degree.
   Poet John Lee Clark, who took 19 years to finish his BA, writes:
   DeafBlind people are capable of gaining knowledge, thinking critically,
   and synthesizing and applying information and thought. Yet only a
   handful of DeafBlind people have graduated from college {[}...] Almost
   all the curricula and syllabi are streamlined around the assumption that
   students are hearing and sighted and can read at a certain speed.
   Schools are navigable for most students. But for DeafBlind students,
   they are nearly impossible. (Clark, 2014, loc 1736)
   The burden of exclusion also falls on classical autistics: DJ Savarese
   is the first non-speaking autistic to graduate from Oberlin College, one
   of only a handful so far in the United States: `No one believed that a
   nonspeaking {[}autistic] could really get into, let alone go to,
   college', he writes (2017). Not only are the accommodations lacking in
   these cases, the neurotypical logic at the heart of the university's
   universalizing mandate actively excludes other ways of knowing. In
   Stephen Kuusisto's words, `{[}u]niversity faculty and administrators are
   not skilled when it comes to thinking about diverse learning styles or
   needs. In historical terms the university is built on a model of
   exclusion, a narrow model, one which suggests quite openly that only
   certain bodies and minds need apply' (2019).
   The exclusive promise of excellence of the universitas has morphed under
   the corporate university.
   `Innovation' is the new mantra of American higher education. It is
   invoked as an indubitable good by college presidents and government
   officials, business advisors and philanthropists alike. It typically
   refers to developments in technology aimed at delivering `educational
   content' and transforming the way that universities themselves work, as
   well as developing products for businesses outside. (Williams, 2016).
   The corporatization of the university under neoliberal capitalism
   exacerbates its exclusionary framework by integrating the university
   more firmly into the economy, one of whose basic operations is to
   produce scarcity through inequality. `Innovation' feeds right into the
   schism between overproduction and uneven resources: `At its core, the
   innovation agenda represents the interests of the business elite over
   those of educators or students. At its worst, it is a property grab of a
   formerly public service' (Williams, 2016).
   `At the present time, {[}...] the system of graduate education is no
   longer understood as being ``like{''} a market; {[}...] graduate
   education is a market' (Bousquet, 2008: 206). In this model, what is
   innovated is capitalism itself. Ironically, the turn toward ``useful{''}
   knowledge in the marketdriven university - the complaint that the
   Humanities, for instance, produces little of marketable value - moves
   counter to capitalism's insatiable appetite for change. Flexibility
   should indeed be the new corporate mantra. Cathy Davidson, arguing for
   alternative pedagogies for the contemporary university, makes a similar
   claim, though not in the service of the neoliberalisation of thought
   (2017).},

Abstract = {Background Tuberculosis remains an important clinical and public health
   issue in South Africa, which has one of the highest tuberculosis burdens
   in the world. We aimed to estimate the burden of bacteriologically
   confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis among people aged 15 years or older in
   South Africa.
   Methods This multistage, cluster-based, cross-sectional survey included
   eligible residents (age >= 15 years, who had slept in a house for >= 10
   nights in the preceding 2 weeks) in 110 clusters nationally (cluster
   size of 500 people; selected by probability proportional-to-population
   size sampling). Participants completed face-to-face symptom
   questionnaires ( for cough, weight loss, fever, and night sweats) and
   manually read digital chest X-ray screening. Screening was recorded as
   positive if participants had at least one symptom or an abnormal chest
   X-ray suggestive of tuberculosis, or a combination thereof. Sputum
   samples from participants who were screen-positive were tested by the
   Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra assay (first sample) and Mycobacteria Growth
   Indicator Tube culture (second sample), with optional HIV testing.
   Participants with a positive Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex culture
   were considered positive for bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary
   tuberculosis; when culture was not positive, participants with a
   positive Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra result with an abnormal chest X-ray
   suggestive of active tuberculosis and without current or previous
   tuberculosis were considered positive for bacteriologically confirmed
   pulmonary tuberculosis.
   Findings Between Aug 15, 2017, and July 28, 2019, 68 771 people were
   enumerated from 110 clusters, with 53 250 eligible to participate in the
   survey, of whom 35 191 (66.1\%) participated. 9066 (25.8\%) of 35 191
   participants were screen-positive and 234 (0.7\%) were identified as
   having bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. Overall, the
   estimated prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary
   tuberculosis was 852 cases (95\% CI 679-1026) per 100 000 population;
   the prevalence was highest in people aged 35-44 years (1107 cases
   {[}95\% CI 703-1511] per 100 000 population) and those aged 65 years or
   older (1104 cases {[}680-1528] per 100 000 population). The estimated
   prevalence was approximately 1.6 times higher in men than in women (1094
   cases {[}95\% CI 835-1352] per 100 000 population vs 675 cases
   {[}494-855] per 100 000 population). 135 (57.7\%) of 234 participants
   with tuberculosis screened positive by chest X-ray only, 16 (6.8\%) by
   symptoms only, and 82 (35.9\%) by both. 55 (28.8\%) of 191 participants
   with tuberculosis with known HIV status were HIV-positive.
   Interpretation Pulmonary tuberculosis prevalence in this survey was
   high, especially in men. Despite the ongoing burden of HIV, many
   participants with tuberculosis in this survey did not have HIV. As more
   than half of the participants with tuberculosis had an abnormal chest
   X-ray without symptoms, prioritising chest X-ray screening could
   substantially increase case finding. Copyright (c) 2022 World Health

Title = {Increasing rice production in Sub-Saharan Africa: Challenges and
   opportunities},

Abstract = {Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) faces multiple problems. The main one is
   improving the lives of the 30\% of its population that suffers from
   extreme poverty and food insecurity. As more than 70\% of the population
   lives off farming and related activities, agricultural development will
   have to play a major role in improving this situation. Fortunately,
   Africa has an abundant supply of natural resources that can support a
   huge expansion in food, specifically rice production. Because of strong
   demand, rice area expansion in SSA is larger than for any other crop.
   Total milled rice production increased from 2.2 million Mg in 1961 to
   9.1 million-Mg in 2004. Rice imports into SSA also increased from 0.5
   million Mg of milled rice in 1961 to 6.0 million Mg in 2003 and SSA
   currently accounts for 25\% of global rice imports, at a cost of more
   than US\$1.5 billion per year. Therefore, many African governments
   accord high priority to developing their local rice sector as an
   important component of national food security, economic growth, and
   poverty alleviation. The abundant supply of agroclimatically suitable
   wetlands (similar to 239 million ha) and water resources can support a
   large expansion in rice area and productivity. Currently, less than 5\%
   of the potentially suitable wetlands are planted with rice because of
   various constraints. Expansion and intensification of rice cultivation
   in SSA will not compete with other crops in terms of land and water
   resources because, during the rainy season, only rice can be grown on
   low-lying wetlands, including inland valleys. In addition, the
   labor-intensive nature of rice cultivation will provide additional
   sources of work and income to the rural poor, especially women. Should
   labor shortages become acute, however, appropriate mechanization can be
   considered. Small farmers want to earn money from rice farming, but lack
   modern inputs and capital to fully exploit their rice lands as these
   items are limited or not available. This is where an innovative
   public-private partnership is desirable to support the intensification
   of rice farming.
   Rice is cultivated in four ecosystems of SSA: dryland (38\% of the
   cultivated rice area), rainfed wetland (33\%), deepwater and mangrove
   swamps (9\%), and irrigated wetland (20\%). Many abiotic stresses
   (drought, flood, and variable rainfall; extreme temperatures; salinity;
   acidity/alkalinity and poor soils, soil erosion, and high P fixation)
   and biotic constraints {[}weeds, blast, Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV),
   and African rice gall midge (AfRGM)] limit rice production on the
   continent. The changing climate is expected to further aggravate the
   abiotic constraints and reduce rice yields in all ecosystems. Rice
   production is also restricted by many technical, management,
   socioeconomic, health, and policy constraints.
   The constraints to irrigated wetland rice in the Sahel of SSA are
   similar to those faced by Asian farmers in the 1960s; therefore,
   well-tested irrigated rice technologies from Asia and elsewhere are
   being introduced and adapted to local conditions to obtain fast returns
   on investment. For rice in irrigated wetlands in the humid and moist
   savanna zones, rainfed wetlands, and drylands, locally developed NERICA
   (new rice for Africa) varieties and production technologies are being
   tested in target environments. The progenies of Oryza glaberrima and O.
   sativa subspecies indica are better adapted to rainfed and irrigated
   wetlands, while those of O. glaberrima and O. sativa subspecies japonica
   are more suited to rainfed drylands. In addition, research is ongoing to
   tackle SSA-specific problems such as RYMV and AfRGM and to develop
   efficient crop management technologies. Currently available best
   management practices (integrated crop management options) for different
   rice ecosystems are shown in Table XV. Additional support through the
   provision of technical advice through revamped national R\&D services; a
   supply of good-quality seed and other inputs, including farm credit; and
   enabling policy are needed for profitable and sustainable
   intensification of rice cultivation in SSA. It is also critical to
   organize preventive health measures for farmers against wetland-related
   diseases (malaria, bilharzia, and so on), protect certain natural
   wetlands (e.g., with bird sanctuaries), preserve mangrove forests in
   strategic coastal belts and rich peats in inlands, and use chemical
   inputs efficiently to minimize pollution and maintain environmental
   quality while intensifying rice production. Anticipatory research is
   needed to tackle the impacts of changing climate on rice farming and the
   environment. Modern information and communication technologies (ICTs)
   can be exploited to reach out to farmers in remote areas and to deploy
   technologies effectively. In addition, the development of innovative
   private-public partnerships and the organization of farmers into
   user-groups will enhance the training, farmer education, and technology
   adoption required for intensive commercial rice farming. (c) 2007,

Abstract = {Socioeconomic inequalities can take different forms. Sometimes they
   appear simply as disparities between individuals or households, or
   between groups that differ on the basis of factors such as social class,
   gender, age, ethnicity, among many others. Likewise, social and economic
   inequalities can be perceived in different geographical scales of
   analysis, between countries or groups of countries, as well as between
   regions, provinces, cities or neighborhoods. Although this paper focuses
   on territorial inequalities, there is no doubt that both levels are
   deeply interrelated.
   At this point, there is no longer any doubt that globalization has gone
   hand in hand with increasing inequality in general and, in particular,
   growing regional disparities in developing countries throughout Latin
   America, Asia, Africa or Eastern Europe, as well as the continuity of
   regional inequalities in developed countries such as Spain, for example.
   This context poses new challenges for the academic investigation of
   inequality, because to explain the phenomenon of unequal regional
   development in a globalized world it is necessary to put the actors of
   this process and their roots in the territory in the center of the
   scene, along with issues such as their position in the economic system
   and the generation and reproduction of power asymmetries.
   Although for some authors globalization acts as an asymmetric process
   that tends to deepen the inequalities between countries and regions, for
   others the problem is not strictly the process of globalization, but the
   way in which countries, regions and firms are inserted and positioned in
   global economy. What is clear is that, being in some way an inevitable
   scenario, globalization contains both opportunities and challenges for
   regional development, while it generates winners and losers among the
   actors and regions involved.
   We believe that the approaches of Global Value Chains (GVC) and Global
   Production Networks (GPN) can be useful tools for understanding the
   relationships between globalization and unequal regional development,
   and for analyzing how actors and regions participate in the global
   economy, how the power and income are distributed among them and what
   possibilities exist for repositioning, among other issues.
   If we look at, for example, the literature on developing countries in
   Latin America, the tendency in recent decades to adopt the conceptual
   framework of GVC is evident, but the contributions from GPN have been
   largely unnoticed so far, which has tended to limit its specific
   application to the analysis of territorial inequalities. On the other
   hand, several authors have highlighted the need to compatibilize, enrich
   and eclectically integrate the analytical frameworks of GVC and GPN.
   The article aims to cover these research niches with a comprehensive
   review of the approaches of global value chains and global production
   networks, hoping that it can be used as a theoretical and methodological
   contribution to the analysis of regional inequalities. This review is
   structured on the basis of a contrast between the respective strengths
   and weaknesses of each approach, showing those points where they can
   complement and enrich each other.
   Throughout the literature there is an old interest in understanding the
   changing forms of organization of production and trade at global level,
   its evolution and its repercussions over territorial inequalities,
   starting for example with dependence theories, center-periphery, world
   system and commodity chains, passing through global commodity chains
   (GCC) and arriving at the further development of GVC. While there are
   some differences in terminology and emphases between the origins of GVC
   and GPN, over the years they have tended to shrink and converge, since
   these approaches are interrelated and share a common agenda of problems.
   Another central aspect is that, despite theoretical discussions (and, in
   particular, criticisms of GPN towards GVC), studies under one tradition
   or another tend to be largely similar, since there are not great
   methodological differences between them. This is directly related to the
   balance of strengths and weaknesses of each approach. On the one hand,
   authors that support the GPN framework value their greater
   analytical-conceptual breadth (covering topics supposedly relegated by
   GVC tradition), but it has the counterpart of making its implementation
   more complex. In contrast, GVC analysis is best understood as a
   methodological approach that can be mobilized within various theoretical
   perspectives, although this greater operational versatility comes with
   the cost of some degree of theoretical eclecticism.
   It should be noted that, although these approaches have been developed,
   such as their own names indicate, over the basis of the
   internationalization and relocation of different circuits of production
   and trade at a global level, their methodological contributions can also
   be applied to domestic chains or networks, making a broad interpretation
   of trade and exports of a particular region to analyze the interaction
   between the local dimension and the extra-regional scale (national or
   international factors).
   As a closure, we can conclude that the GVC approach is applicable to
   regional analysis (avoiding some analytical complexities of GPN) but it
   needs to be strengthened with some elements of GPN tradition. In
   particular, it is necessary to reinforce the territoriality of chains of
   networks, to widen the spectrum of institutions taken into account and
   to analyze their relations from a multidimensional (vertical,
   horizontal, diagonal) and multiscalar perspective (regional, national,
   international, global). At the same time, it is necessary to keep in
   mind the existence of different types of networks, power relations and
   possibilities of upgrading.
   At this point we should also point out some possible restrictions or
   weaknesses for the application of the approaches of GVC and GPN to the
   analysis of uneven regional development. On the one hand, the idea of
   inequality necessarily relates with economic processes that, by their
   own nature, can adopt asymmetric and divergent characteristics. But
   unlike the analytical (often critical) perspectives we present in this
   paper, the use of the concept of global value chains has become popular
   in recent years and has entered into the agendas of international
   organizations and multilateral forums that tend to adopt a highly
   optimistic (or uncritical) view towards globalization and its possible
   impacts on the progress of underdeveloped countries and regions. By
   circumventing or minimizing the potentially negative and inequitable
   factors discussed in the article, this can strongly change public policy
   recommendations and strategies.
   On the other hand, a weakness of GVC and GPN literatures is the limited
   recognition that innovation, knowledge and technology have usually
   received. In any case, these approaches recognize the importance of
   innovation as a basic input for upgrading processes, but little is said
   about the specific nature of the complex processes of learning and
   innovation, which represents an interesting line of work to be covered.},

Abstract = {Developing-country rangelands are vast and diverse. They are home to
   millions who are often poor, politically marginalized, and dependent on
   livestock for survival. Here we summarize our experiences from six
   case-study sites in sub-Saharan Africa, central Asia, and Latin America
   generally covering the past 25 years. We examine issues pertaining to
   population, natural resource management, climate, land use, livestock
   marketing, social conflict, and pastoral livelihoods. The six study
   sites differ with respect to human and livestock population dynamics and
   the resulting pressures on natural resources. Environmental degradation,
   however, has been commonly observed. Climate change is also having
   diverse systemic effects often related to increasing aridity. As
   rangelands become more economically developed pastoral livelihoods may
   diversify, food security can improve, and commercial livestock
   production expands, but wealth stratification widens. Some significant
   upgrades in rural infrastructure and public service delivery have
   occurred; telecommunications are markedly improved overall due to
   widespread adoption of mobile phones. Pressures from grazing, farming,
   mining, and other land uses-combined with drought-can ignite local
   conflicts over resources, although the intensity and scope of conflicts
   markedly varies across our case-study sites. Pastoralists and their
   herds have become more sedentary overall due to many factors, and this
   can undermine traditional risk-management tactics based on mobility.
   Remote rangelands still offer safe havens for insurgents, warlords, and
   criminals especially in countries where policing remains weak; the
   resulting civil strife can undermine commerce and public safety. There
   has been tremendous growth in knowledge concerning developing-country
   rangelands since 1990, but this has not often translated into improved
   environmental stewardship or an enhanced wellbeing for rangeland
   dwellers. Some examples of demonstrable impact are described, and these
   typically have involved longer-term investments in capacity building for
   pastoralists, local professionals, and other stakeholders. Research is
   shifting from ecologically centered to more human-centered issues;
   traditional academic approaches are often being augmented with
   participatory, community-based engagement. Building human or social
   capital in ways that are integrated with improved natural resource
   stewardship offers the greatest returns on research investment. Our
   future research and outreach priorities include work that fortifies
   pastoral governance, enhances livelihoods for a diverse array of
   rangeland residents, and improves land and livestock management in a
   comprehensive social-ecological systems approach.},

Title = {Dual Use of a Patient Portal and Clinical Video Telehealth by Veterans
   with Mental Health Diagnoses: Retrospective, Cross-Sectional Analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Background: Access to mental health care is challenging. The Veterans
   Health Administration (VHA) has been addressing these challenges through
   technological innovations including the implementation of Clinical Video
   Telehealth, two-way interactive and synchronous videoconferencing
   between a provider and a patient, and an electronic patient portal and
   personal health record, My HealtheVet.
   Objective: This study aimed to describe early adoption and use of My
   HealtheVet and Clinical Video Telehealth among VHA users with mental
   health diagnoses.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of early
   My HealtheVet adoption and Clinical Video Telehealth engagement among
   veterans with one or more mental health diagnoses who were VHA users
   from 2007 to 2012. We categorized veterans into four electronic health
   (eHealth) technology use groups: My HealtheVet only, Clinical Video
   Telehealth only, dual users who used both, and nonusers of either. We
   examined demographic characteristics and mental health diagnoses by
   group. We explored My HealtheVet feature use among My HealtheVet
   adopters. We then explored predictors of My HealtheVet adoption,
   Clinical Video Telehealth engagement, and dual use using multivariate
   logistic regression.
   Results: Among 2.17 million veterans with one or more mental health
   diagnoses, 1.51\% (32,723/2,171,325) were dual users, and 71.72\%
   (1,557,218/2,171,325) were nonusers of both My HealtheVet and Clinical
   Video Telehealth. African American and Latino patients were
   significantly less likely to engage in Clinical Video Telehealth or use
   My HealtheVet compared with white patients. Low-income patients who met
   the criteria for free care were significantly less likely to be My
   HealtheVet or dual users than those who did not. The odds of Clinical
   Video Telehealth engagement and dual use decreased with increasing age.
   Women were more likely than men to be My HealtheVet or dual users but
   less likely than men to be Clinical Video Telehealth users. Patients
   with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were significantly less
   likely to be My HealtheVet or dual users than those with other mental
   health diagnoses (odds ratio, OR 0.50, CI 0.47-0.53 and OR 0.75, CI
   0.69-0.80, respectively). Dual users were younger (53.08 years, SD 13.7,
   vs 60.11 years, SD 15.83), more likely to be white, and less likely to
   be low-income than the overall cohort. Although rural patients had 17\%
   lower odds of My HealtheVet adoption compared with urban patients (OR
   0.83, 95\% CI 0.80-0.87), they were substantially more likely than their
   urban counterparts to engage in Clinical Video Telehealth and dual use
   (OR 2.45, 95\% CI 1.95-3.09 for Clinical Video Telehealth and OR 2.11,
   95\% CI 1.81-2.47 for dual use).
   Conclusions: During this study (2007-2012), use of these technologies
   was low, leaving much potential for growth. There were sociodemographic
   disparities in access to My HealtheVet and Clinical Video Telehealth and
   in dual use of these technologies. There was also variation based on
   types of mental health diagnosis. More research is needed to ensure that
   these and other patient-facing eHealth technologies are accessible and
   effectively used by all vulnerable patients.},

Abstract = {Background: Social isolation, loneliness and anxiety-depressive states
   are emerging health conditions in the elderly. Research question: To
   assess whether a 4-month programme of physical activity in a group
   improves the emotional, social and quality of life situation in a sample
   of subjects over 64 years old people. Methods: Multi-centre randomized
   clinical trial of two groups. Study population: Patients older than 64
   years assigned to three primary care teams from different locations.
   Inclusion criteria: Submit a score <32 on the DUKE-UNC-11 social support
   scale, or >12 on the Beck Depression Scale, or >10 on the Generalized
   Anxiety Scale (GAD-7), at the start of the study. The intervention group
   participated in a group physical activity program for 4-months that
   consisted of progressively walking sessions two days a week, 60-150
   minutes long depending on the physical condition of each participant.
   Results: Enrolled were 94 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Mean
   age was 74 years (SD 5.18) and 76.6\% were women. No significant
   differences were found at the beginning of the study between the two
   groups in relation to the outcome of the scales evaluated. Once the
   intervention was completed, improvement in the quality of life and
   social support was detected in the intervention group (p<.05). Both
   groups improved the depression and anxiety clinic but the improvement in
   the participants of the intervention group was higher. Those with
   initial depression improved 8.6 points on the scale, compared to the
   control that improved 3.3 points, with the final average of 17.4. Those
   who presented initial anxiety improved 8 points (final average: 7.5
   points, cut-off point for the diagnosis of anxiety 10), compared to the
   control that improved 5.1 points. Conclusion: The results of this study
   indicate that the program developed has positive effects on improving
   the quality of life, social support and depression and anxiety clinic.
   Background: Tourism represents 45\% gross domestic product in Balearic
   Islands. Working as a hotel housekeeper (HH) has been associated with
   important morbidity, especially musculoskeletal, chronic pain, a
   significant number of sick leaves, a high consumption of medication,
   poor psychological well-being and worse quality of life. Research
   question: Explore perceptions and opinions regarding the HH's work and
   health problems. Estimate and evaluate HH's health determinants, the
   exposition to several occupational risk factors, their lifestyles and
   health problems and their quality of life. Methods: Design: mixed
   methods: (1) exploratory qualitative study (QS) including 10
   semi-structured interviews and six focus groups; (2). descriptive study
   (DS): individual interviews and clinical medical records. Inclusion
   criteria: older than 18 years, had worked during the last summer season
   in the Balearic Islands. Analysis: QS: transcription and content
   analysis; DS: descriptive statistical analysis. Results: QS: Identified
   positive aspects of their work: timetables, relationship with
   co-workers, attending clients. Highlighted negative aspects: working
   conditions, hard physical workload, stressful duties and insufficiently
   rewarded. HH associated their health problems with their work; coping
   strategies: self-medication or visiting their general practitioner. DS:
   1.043 HH included. Mean age 43.3 years, mean working years as HH 10.7
   years. Mean rooms/day: 18.1 (+/- 6.5); mean beds/day: 44.6 (+/- 20.7).
   HH reported often pain during the last summer season: 68.2\% (IC 95\%
   65.3-71.0) low back pain; 60.9\% (IC 95\% 57.8-63.8) wrist and hands;
   55.3\% (IC 95\% 52.2-58.3) cervical. 41.6\% and 35.1\% self-reported
   regular and poor health status, respectively. Conclusion: HH perceived
   hard and stressful working conditions, partly justified by the number of
   rooms and beds made per day. They also perceived health problems related
   to their work. HH frequently reported pain during the last summer
   season. Moreover, they perceive regular or poor health status, weaker
   than women from the same social class do.
   Background: Gender-based violence (GBV) is a public health and human
   rights issue, being highly prevalent (12-51\%), repetitive and having a
   severe impact on women's health, with a high sanitary and social cost.
   Primary care has a key role in detection and management. There is low
   detection and delay in diagnosis. There is a lack of preparation to
   recognize abuse, especially in the approach and action after detection.
   Greater awareness and sensitization is required. Research question: Can
   a brief specific training intervention in GBV imparted to primary health
   care professionals in their primary health centre increase knowledge,
   improve attitudes and skills? Methods: A cluster-randomized clinical
   trial was carried out in Vigo area primary health centres with at least
   20 health care professionals. A basal evaluation was made through a
   validated inquiry (PREMIS), which they had to retake after three months.
   In the intervention centres, a clinical session was imparted. pResults:
   Out of 264 primary health care professionals, 145 participated. There
   was a 63.5\% loss out of 145 professionals. A statistically significant
   difference was detected in the field of knowledge, increasing an average
   of two points on a scale from 0 to 5 in these aspects: how to make
   appropriate questions; connections between GBV and pregnancy; why do not
   they leave their partners; risk determination and phases of GBV. There
   was also a decrease in the idea that if the patient does not recognize
   gender violence, there is very little that can be done. No significant
   differences were detected in the detection and follow-up. Conclusion:
   Significant differences were found in the knowledge and attitude
   sections after performing the intervention to the professionals. The
   results support the implementation of continuous brief training on GBV
   in primary care.
   Background: Out-of-hours (OOH) primary care is a topic of great interest
   in European countries. Reasons for this are similar across borders: to
   guarantee continuity of care with decreasing numbers of health care
   workers and to guard equity in OOHcare for all patients. In OOHcare
   research, valid and accessible research data are needed to fill the
   knowledge gap. iCAREdata aims to offer valid and immediately available
   information from OOHcare. Research question: How feasible is it to
   collect, store and link data of different OOH services in Belgium and to
   improve data quality registration? How useful are aggregated data to
   inform stakeholders, to evaluate (the quality of) services in OOH care
   and the effects of interventions? Methods: As a first achievement, data
   flows, encryption and encoding were carefully designed and implemented.
   Solid cooperation with the federal eHealth web services as a trusted
   third party was crucial. Ethical approval and approval by the data
   protection authority was obtained. Clear agreements were established
   concerning access control. A strict code of conduct was agreed upon. A
   steering committee was established to guard the procedures. Results:
   First data were collected in 2015. iCAREdata now receives +/- 3000
   unique patient contacts per weekend, spread over 14 general practice
   cooperatives, and covering about a quarter of the Flemish population.
   Aggregated data, directly processed, are provided weekly on . This
   portal site offers an overview of, among others, the latest diagnostics,
   drug prescriptions and workload. iCAREdata project also collects data
   from emergency departments in hospitals and community pharmacists and
   link them to evaluate further OOH primary care. Conclusion: Developing a
   research database on OOHcare is feasible. The iCAREdata project succeeds
   in an automated output every week, offering insights on the evolution of
   morbidity, services and effects of interventions. Careful validation and
   interpretation of the data is a crucial ongoing challenge.
   Background: More than half of decompensations of heart failure are
   attended in primary care setting. No score that helps to ascertain the
   short-term prognosis in these patients. Research question: To develop
   and validate a short-term score (30 days) to predict hospitalizations or
   death in patients attended in primary care as a consequence of
   decompensation of heart failure, based on variables easily measurable in
   primary care setting Methods: Prospective multinational cohort study
   including patients treated because of a heart failure decompensation in
   primary care setting. There were a derivation (Spain) and a validation
   cohort (nine European countries). Results: The derivation cohort
   included 561 patients, women were 56\%, mean age was 82.2 (SD 8.03)
   years and 31.5\% of patients were hospitalized or died in the first
   month. In the validation cohort, 238 patients were included, women were
   54\%, mean age was 79.0 (10.4) years and 26.9\% of patients were
   hospitalized or died in the first month. According to the multivariate
   models, sex, age, hospital admission due to heart failure the previous
   year, and a heart rate greater than 100 beats/minute, orthopnoea,
   paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, NYHA functional stage III or IV,
   saturation of oxygen lower than 90\% or an increase in the dyspnoea at
   the consultation with the General practitioner were included in the
   HEFESTOS-SCORE. The multivariate model including these variables showed
   a good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow p=.35) and discrimination (AUC 0.81,
   95\% CI 0.77-0.85). In the validation cohort, the model presented an
   adequate external validation with good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow
   p=.35) and discrimination (AUC 0.74, 95\% CI 0.67-0.82). Conclusion: The
   HEFESTOS-SCORE, based on clinical and demographical variables easily
   measurable in primary care is a useful tool to stratify the short-term
   hospitalization and mortality in patients attended because of a heart
   failure decompensation.
   Background: Despite recommendations against long-term benzodiazepine
   (BZD) use, they are often prescribed during months or years in primary
   care. Research question: To determine facilitators and barriers that
   explain the variation in implementation of a primary care educational
   and feedback intervention targeted to general practitioners (GPs) to
   reduce BZDs prescriptions. Methods: A hybrid type I clinical trial:
   qualitative data to evaluate the implementation outcomes. Three health
   districts of Spain: Balearic Islands, Tarragona-Reus district
   (Catalonia) and Arnau de Vilanova lliria district (Valencia). Forty
   stakeholders (GPs) participated in five focus groups; they were selected
   based on their effectiveness of the intervention results: high (three
   groups) or low (two groups) and individual interviews to two GP of low
   efficiency. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research
   (CFIR) was used to guide collection and analysis of qualitative data.
   Two researchers evaluated the qualitative data of the focus groups by
   the Codebook and Rating Rules of CFIR, independently. Results: Of the 31
   CFIR constructs assessed, three constructs strongly distinguished
   between GPs with low versus high success of the intervention
   (intervention complexity, individual state of change, key stakeholders
   engaging), seven additional constructs weakly distinguished
   (adaptability, external policy and incentives, implementation climate,
   compatibility, relative priority, self-efficacy, formally appointed
   internal implementation leaders), 10 had insufficient data to assess and
   11 were non-related to the success of the intervention. Conclusion: We
   identified the constructs that explain the variation in the
   effectiveness of the intervention; this information is relevant to
   redesign successful implementation strategies focused on these
   constructs to implement the BENZORED intervention in health services.
   Background: Despite recommendations against long-term benzodiazepine
   (BZD) use, they are often prescribed during months or years in primary
   care. Research question: To evaluate the effectiveness of a primary care
   educational and feedback intervention targeted to general practitioners
   (GPs) to reduce BZDs prescriptions. Methods: Design: A two-arm parallel
   cluster randomized clinical trial. Settings: Primary Healthcare centres
   from three health districts of Spain: Balearic Islands (IbSalut),
   Catalonia (Institut Catala de la Salut; Tarragona-Reus district) and
   Community of Valencia (Conselleria de Salut Universal; Arnau de Vilanova
   lliria district). Participants: All GPs from the health districts
   included were invited to participate. Ninety percent of the GPs accepted
   to participate. Intervention: GPs received an educational two hours
   workshop training about the rationale for prescribing BZDs and
   deprescribing strategies for long-term BZD users, audit and monthly
   feedback about their prescription and access to a support web page with
   information to help them and leaflets to give to the patients. Control
   group: GPs did not receive any component of the intervention. Outcomes:
   Defined daily dose (DDD)/1000 inhabitants/year (DHD) of BZDs prescribed
   by GP at 12 months. Proportion of long-term BZD users (>6 months) and in
   patients aged 65 or more at 12 months. Statistical analysis: Generalized
   mixed linear random effect models to account for clustering at the level
   of healthcare centre and all analyses were based on an intention to
   treat principle. Results: We included 749 GPs and 49 (6.5\%) were lost
   to follow-up. Adjusted difference between groups in DHD at 12 months was
   -3.26 (-4.87;-1.65), p<.001. The differences in the proportion of
   long-term BZD users was -0.39 (-0.58;-0.19), p<.001 and in patients
   older than 65 was -0.87 (-1.35;-0.26), p=.004. Conclusion: An
   educational and feedback intervention targeted to GPs is effective to
   reduce BZD prescription in primary care.
   Background: Patients who might also go to the general practitioner (GP)
   frequently consult emergency departments (ED). This leads to decreased
   efficiency, high workload at the ED and additional costs for both
   government and patient. Research question: The primary outcome is the
   proportion of patients who enter the ED and are handled by the GP after
   triage. Secondary outcomes: Referral rate to the ED by the GP,
   proportion of patients not following the triage advice, compliance of
   the nurse to the triage-instructions and health insurance expenditures.
   Furthermore, facilitators and barriers will be studied and an incident
   analysis will be performed. Methods: This is a randomised controlled
   trial with weekends serving as clusters. Patients presenting at the ED
   during OOH are triaged and allocated to either ED or GP by a trained
   nurse using an extension to the Manchester Triage System (MTS). During
   control clusters, all patients remain at the ED. Data are collected
   using a database for OOH care (iCAREdata). Results: So far, 296 out of
   2733 (11\%) patients were allocated to the GP. Two-thirds (194) of these
   patients did go to the GP leading to a primary outcome of 7\% for 14
   intervention weekends. Only eight patients were referred back to the ED.
   Compliance of the nurse to the extended MTS was 93\%, in 6\% of the
   cases the nurse chose ED instead of GPC and in less than one percent GPC
   instead of ED. The nurses chose higher urgency categories and more
   discriminators, leading to the GP during intervention clusters. Using an
   automated system, these results are updated weekly, on our poster, we
   will show more results that are complete. Conclusion: These first
   results reveal a low efficiency but a high safety of the intervention.
   More prolonged data collection combined with a process analysis and cost
   efficiency study is necessary before definitive conclusions can be
   drawn.
   Background: Low back pain is a multifactorial condition with individual
   and societal impact. Psychosocial factors play a larger prognostic roll.
   Therefore, earlier multidisciplinary treatment strategy (physical,
   psychological and social/occupational) could be applied to search
   improvement in fear-avoidance beliefs with positive effect in the
   evolution of low back pain. Research question: Evaluate the
   effectiveness of a biopsychosocial multidisciplinary intervention
   (physiotherapy, cognitive-behavioural and pharmacological therapy)
   through the changes in fear-avoidance beliefs (FABs), in working
   population with sub-acute non-specific LBP, compared to usual clinical
   care at 3 and 12 months. Methods: A cluster randomised clinical trial,
   conducted in 39 Primary Health Care Centres (PHCC) in Barcelona.
   Participants between 18 and 65 years old (n = 369; control group =188,
   PHCC 26 and intervention group =181, PHCC 13). Control group received
   usual care, according to guidelines. Intervention group received usual
   care plus a biopsychosocial multidisciplinary intervention (sessions 10
   hours/total). The main outcome was the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs
   questionnaire (FABQ). Other outcomes: Evolution to chronicity.
   Assessment at baseline, 3 and 12 months. Analysis was by intention to
   treat and analyst blinded. Multiple imputations. Results: Of the 369
   enrolled patients with LBP, 421 (84.0\%) provided data at the three
   months of follow-up, and 387 (77.2\%) at 12 months. Mean age of study
   subjects at baseline was 45.1 (SD: 10.4) years-old and 61.2\% were
   women. At baseline, there were no differences. Both groups showed a
   decrease in FABQ (FAB physical and FAB-work) at three months and twelve
   months, with a significant difference at long-term. At FAB-physical
   performance, there was no significant difference over the follow-up time
   and at FAB-Work, a substantial difference at 12 months between groups.
   Conclusion: A multidisciplinary biopsychosocial intervention showed a
   positive effect in FABs by improving fear behaviours and avoidance at
   work.
   Community participation in primary healthcare is enshrined in
   international policies since the 1970s and has been re-emphasised since
   then, most recently in the 2018 WHO Astana Declaration (). The concept
   comes from a social justice perspective. It emphasises that the
   participation of communities who experience poverty and social exclusion
   is essential to the development of primary health care services shaping
   these services and making them relevant to those with the greatest need.
   This is important if we are to address the well-documented Inverse Care
   Law. There is, however, a translational gap between policy and practice.
   The stability of policies for community participation in primary
   healthcare is patchy. The implementation of policies into conventional
   ways of working is patchy. Where implementation has occurred, the
   coverage of community participation initiatives can be patchy - not all
   community members are involved. The literature shows a pattern of
   exclusion whereby so-called `hard to reach' groups are not adequately
   involved in primary healthcare decision-making. This is the case for
   refugees and migrants who arrive to settle and integrate into host
   countries in Europe. The recent WHO Strategy and Action Plan for Refugee
   and Migrant Health (2016; ) is a call for action to disrupt this pattern
   of exclusion and improve the health of refugees and migrants. Drawing on
   the rich tradition of participatory health research is a valuable way
   forward because it provides important concepts, tools and techniques for
   research that is more inclusive and primary care practice. This
   presentation will describe innovative examples of success in family
   practice settings from around Europe. These have brought together
   refugees and migrants with primary care stakeholders and enabled them to
   work together to introduce and sustain changes in clinical practice.
   This evidence can be used to guide and strengthen community
   participation in primary healthcare, for all.
   Background: Community participation is essential for effective
   implementation of research programmes in primary healthcare (PHC) but
   also appropriate interpretation of results and optimal delivery of
   subsequent care. Stakeholder engagement undertaken under defined and
   evaluated frameworks may be key for the establishment of concrete
   collaboration and communication between communities and other parties
   involved in research. This abstract aims to report on community and
   stakeholder engagement methodologies, plans and activities of European
   research projects conducted in Crete, Greece. Research question: Could a
   consensus be reached regarding the methods and tools for enhancing
   stakeholder engagement in community-oriented PHC research? Methods:
   Examined programmes included RESTORE (FP7), FRESH AIR (Horizon2020) and
   VIGOUR (Health Programme). Identified methodologies included
   Normalisation Process Theory, Participatory Learning and Action, Five
   Steps of Stakeholders' Engagement, establishment of Stakeholder
   Engagement Groups under the 9 C's model (commissioners, customers,
   collaborators, contributors, channels, commentators, consumers,
   champions, competitors) and Structured Democratic Dialogue. These were
   implemented to a range of stakeholders, including community members,
   patients, migrants, Roma populations, healthcare professionals and
   policy-makers. Qualitative research (focus groups, individual
   interviews) and Thematic Content Analysis were used for design and
   analysis of engagement activities. Results: In RESTORE, migrants and
   other stakeholders selected guidelines and training supporting
   cross-cultural communication in PHC consultations, based on their own
   needs and expectations. Community members, healthcare professionals and
   healthcare authorities were actively involved in FRESH AIR by
   identifying local priorities and contextual factors for designing
   project interventions, providing access to communities and supporting
   dissemination of project achievements. In VIGOUR, multidisciplinary
   stakeholders were brought together and formulated a joint ambition
   statement for the future of integrated care in Crete. Conclusion:
   Various stakeholder engagement methods with documented effects are
   currently available. Their systematic identification, appraisal,
   synthesis and consolidation may serve with enhancing community
   participation in PHC, sustaining research results and translating
   findings into appropriate actions.
   Background: Screening for prostate cancer remains controversial,
   implying a trade-off between benefits and harms, and a shared
   decision-making process has been advocated. Decision aids are
   evidence-based tools that improve decision quality. For limited-resource
   countries, translating and making cultural adaptations to high-quality
   decision aids is a reasonable alternative to developing new ones.
   Research question: We aimed to translate and culturally adapt an English
   language patient decision aid addressing prostate cancer screening, so
   that Portuguese men can use it. Methods: We followed the European Centre
   for Disease Prevention and Control's (ECDC) five-step, stakeholder-based
   approach to adapting health communication materials: (1) selection of
   materials and process coordinators; (2) early review; (3) translation
   and back translation; (4) comprehension testing with cognitive
   semi-structured interviews; (5) proofreading. Cognitive interviews were
   conducted with 15 men, ages 55-69, from the Oporto district local
   community to refine the decision aid after its translation. Content
   analysis was performed using Ligre (TM) software. Results: Five main
   themes are presented: informational content, information comprehension,
   socio-cultural appropriateness, feelings and primary message, and
   personal perspective concerning prostate cancer screening. For each
   theme, illustrative quotes extracted from men's interviews are
   presented. Most men found the translated version of the decision aid to
   be clear, comprehensive and appropriate for its target population,
   albeit some suggested that medical terms could be a barrier. The data
   collected from men's interviews allowed the researchers to clarify
   concepts and expand existing content. Conclusion: The final version of
   the decision aid can be used in the real world clinical setting and our
   ECDC based approach can be replicated by other workgroups to translate
   and culturally adapt decision aids.
   What are we talking about when we talk about value? In 2006, Michael
   Porter and Elizabeth O. Teisberg published; Redefining Health Care,
   Creating Value-Based Competition on Results, Harvard Business School
   Press. Affirming that payers and providers, including doctors and
   nurses, are very concerned in demonstrating that they work a lot, and
   very little, or nothing, in assessing what their work contributes to the
   health of people and communities. Michael Porter is famous in the
   business world for his work on competitiveness based on the value of
   products and services. He has introduced this concept in the provision
   of health services, all summarised in a phrase: Health systems should
   seek to obtain the maximum possible value for the health of people for
   every dollar they spend. However, to define the value in healthcare, the
   patient must be introduced into the equation, so, in Porterian terms,
   the value is the perception that people have about clinical
   effectiveness and the costs of therapeutic processes. Clinical
   effectiveness is measurable from epidemiology (to be readmitted to a
   hospital fewer times or living longer); value, on the other hand, is
   reflected by people's experience. We need to ask questions such as do
   patients with advanced diseases want to live longer, or they want to
   enjoy the highest quality of life possible. Depending on the response,
   we can develop different delivery models. What is value-based
   healthcare? According to NEJM Catalyst, Value-based healthcare is a
   healthcare delivery model in which providers, including hospitals and
   physicians, are paid based on patient health outcomes (). Under
   value-based care agreements, providers are rewarded for helping patients
   improve their health, reduce the effects and incidence of chronic
   disease, and live healthier lives in an evidence-based way. How to
   achieve a Value-Based Healthcare Model The following six drivers are the
   key to make a primary health care system a value-based healthcare model:
   1. Prioritising patient-centred care. 2. From clinical pathways to care
   delivery value chains. 3. Promoting the right care and reducing medical
   overuse. 4. Turning a fragmented model into another integrated model. 5.
   Creating the enabling environment for healthcare transformation. 6.
   Fostering community health. How to develop a Value-Based Community
   Health Michael Marmot states that if the determinants of health are
   mostly social, solutions must also be social, so to improve the quality
   of community life, political systems require economic, housing,
   education, security and infrastructure programs (Am J Public Health.
   2014;104:S517-S519). Nevertheless, the healthcare system must know how
   to adjust resources according to the social circumstances of each
   community and to understand how to provide a health-oriented vision of
   all the social programs. On the other hand, community health is an
   intervention model that aims to improve the health of a defined
   community that should operate from primary care services to adjust their
   actions to the social reality of each territory.
   Background: Geriatric care needs to be increased with growing elderly
   populations. The Borgholm jurisdiction in the Baltic Island of oland
   (Kalmar region) has an older than average senior population and had
   difficulties recruiting primary care physicians (PCPs) resulting in high
   elderly hospital care consumption. Research question: Could a new model
   of geriatric care be able to decrease the hospital care needs of
   Borgholm as compared to the rest of Kalmar region? Methods: A new model
   of care was developed in Borgholm 2016-2017 where the PCP list was
   limited to 1000 patients, daily slots for PCP home care visits could be
   booked by community nurses or ambulance nurses and PCPs had daily
   anticipatory care planning contacts with Kalmar hospital staff. Results:
   Between 2014 and 2018, Borgholm home care patients >75 years old
   increased by 70\% vs. a 2\% decrease for the rest of Kalmar region.
   Similarly, Kalmar emergency department visits decreased by 19\% in
   Borgholm vs. 9\% increase for the rest of Kalmar. Also, Kalmar hospital
   care episodes decreased 7\% in Borgholm vs. 13\% increase for the rest
   of Kalmar; Kalmar hospital outpatient visits decreased 8\% in Borgholm
   vs. 21\% increase for the rest of Kalmar; total care consumption for >75
   years old decreased 4\% in Borgholm vs. a 10\% increase for the rest of
   Kalmar region. Conclusion: A new geriatric care model consisting of a
   comprehensive collaboration between strengthened primary care and
   community care, hospital care and ambulance care was associated with a
   reduction in total care consumption for senior citizens in a rural
   Swedish jurisdiction.
   Background: Primary health care, the general practitioner, plays a
   critical role for early identification and care of patients with
   dementia. Early diagnosis of dementia allows starting therapy and
   improving the quality of life of the patients. Research question: To
   estimate the prevalence and care of patients with dementia in North
   Macedonia. Methods: Forty-six general practitioners (GPs) surgeries from
   20 cities in Macedonia took part in the project. All individuals age
   over 65 years with a diagnosis of dementia were identified from GP
   electronic disease registers. Results: Based on the diagnosis, 450
   (3.5\%) patients were identified from a total population of 12,926 over
   65s. The most common dementia was Alzheimer's dementia 294 (65.3\%)
   followed by vascular dementia 27.11\%. The average age of respondents in
   the study was 77.5 +/- 8.2 years, with 50\% patients under the age of 79
   years, 65.6\% were female and 68.4\% were with elementary school. In the
   entire sample, most of the patients diagnosed with dementia 195 (43.3\%)
   said they lived with another family member. The most common risk factor
   was hypertension (85.1\%), followed by stroke/ transitory ischemic
   attacks (29.3\%) and equal percentage, i.e. 26.4\% of patients had high
   levels of cholesterol and diabetes. To 242 (53.8\%) acetylcholinesterase
   inhibitors were prescribed (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine), 77
   (17.1\%) memantine, while 247 (54.9\%) another OTC therapy. 227 (50.4\%)
   reported that they did not receive treatment. An additional analysis of
   the reasons for not receiving treatment was made on this sample of
   patients who did not receive treatment. It was found that in the
   majority of these patients (more than 50\%) the reason for not receiving
   therapy was that it was not prescribed, in 142 (62.6\%). Conclusion:
   This is the first national representative study of dementia prevalence
   in North Macedonia. Those data can provide information for healthcare
   needs people with dementia.
   Background: Emotional experience for medical students during clinical
   internships is often ignored. Yet, its influence on professional skills
   is certain. Research question: `What is the emotional experience of
   second and third-year medical students during their first clinical
   internship? How do they perceive the management of their experience by
   their supervisors?' Methods: A qualitative study was conducted with 12
   students in their second or third year of medical training at the
   University of Lille, in France, between 2016 and 2019. Interviews were
   carried out comprehensively for a total of 17 hours. Following a
   grounded theory approach, the analysis terminated when data were
   sufficient to offer a conclusive model. Results: Emotional experience
   during clinical internship was rich and intense. It was most often
   ignored and was not taken into account in the development of
   professional skills. The organized management was deficient. Informal
   training existed: when a wilful student met a dedicated teacher.
   Students would have welcomed a possibility to experience intense
   emotions in a protective environment, and only then in an empowering
   environment. They expressed the same desire about early exchanges on the
   experiences of the internship. A modelling of the informants' emotional
   experiences was realized in the form of three diagrams. Conclusion:
   Students ask to be challenged to face patients, and then to be listened
   to about it. Possible interventions are trauma prevention and detection
   of malaise in the workplace; teaching of humanist values; providing
   experience and reflexivity through new pedagogical means (such as
   cinema, theatre, literature, writing), or relational means (such as
   exchange groups, companionship, solidarity commitment, immersive
   internships and tutoring); and training supervisors.
   Background: Oral anticoagulants (OAC) reduce the risk for stroke and
   death from all causes in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation
   (NVAF). Research question: To explore adherence rates to OAC among
   patients with NVAF and to compare head-to-head adherence rate of
   different medications in long-term chronic use. Methods: We conducted a
   population-based cohort study Clalit Health Services, Israel. All
   patients, 30 years and over, with a diagnosis of NVAF before 2016 and
   were treated with OAC were included. We included patients that filled at
   least one prescription per year in the three consecutive years
   2016-2018. We analysed all prescriptions that were filled for the
   medications from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017. We considered
   purchasing of at least nine monthly prescriptions during 2017 as `good
   medication adherence.' Results: Twenty-six thousand and twenty-nine
   patients with NVAF who were treated with OAC were identified. Ten
   thousand and two hundred and eighty-four (39.5\%) were treated with
   apixaban, 6321 (24.3\%) were treated with warfarin, 6290 (24.1\%) were
   treated with rivaroxaban 3134 (12.0\%) were treated with dabigatran.
   Rates of good medication adherence were 88.9\% for rivaroxaban, 84.9\%
   for apixaban, 83.6\% for dabigatran and 55.8\% for warfarin (p<.0001).
   Good adherence with OAC was associated with lower LDL cholesterol and
   glucose levels. Advanced age was associated with higher adherence rates
   (p<.001). SES was not associated with medication adherence. Conclusion:
   Adherence rates to DOAC among patients with NVAF are high and are higher
   than the adherence rate to warfarin. It should be taken into
   consideration when choosing OAC treatment for NVAF.
   Background: In France, cervical cancer screening by pap-smears should be
   conducted triennially. Screening statistics are based on the number of
   cytology examinations of smears reimbursed by the Health Insurance
   appearing in the claim databases. The percentage of screened women is
   lower based on these data than on declarative surveys. If surveys are
   overestimating the number of screened women, it is likely that claim
   databases underestimate it. Research question: The primary objective was
   to determine the underestimation of screened women in claim databases.
   The secondary purpose was to estimate the proportion of female patients
   not reachable by their GP for a cervical cancer screening in an
   organized screening trial. Methods: The population was the 6327 female
   patients aged 30-65 years of the 24 GP investigators of the PaCUDAHL-Ge
   trial. We compared the lists of their female patients that had no
   cytology of Pap test reimbursed during the three prior years, extracted
   from the Health Insurance claim databases in 2015 and 2018. We selected
   the patients appearing on both lists meaning they had not responded to
   the invitation of their GP to be screened in the trial. We searched in
   the GPs' records valid reasons not to be screened (hysterectomy, history
   of cervical lesion, pregnancy, other conditions making screening
   irrelevant) or evidence of screening. Results: The total number of
   `unscreened' women in 2018 was 2731, 1737 patients appeared on both
   lists, 1522 could be included for analysing, 65 had been screened, 95
   had hysterectomy, three had a history of cervical lesion, nine were
   pregnant and 10 had other conditions making screening irrelevant, 166
   patients were lost to view. Conclusion: Based on GPs' records, health
   insurance claim databases underestimate the number of screened women by
   7.6\%. The percentage of patients not responding to the invitation of
   their GP to be screened in the PaCUDAHL-Ge trial is 24.18\%.
   Background: Over the past decade, the amount of digital data created by
   humans with or without connected tools has grown exponentially. The
   field of primary care (PC) did not escape this digitization, nor the use
   of Big Data algorithms. To evaluate the results of Big Data research in
   PC it seemed useful to identify which algorithms are used. Research
   question: What are the algorithms used for Big Data research in PC
   research and how are they described? Methods: Systematic review of the
   literature according to the recommendations of the PRISMA guide. A
   search equation using the following MeSH terms `big data, data mining,
   Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, Deep Learning,
   Neural Networks Natural Language Processing, general practice,
   electronic health records, health records' has been applied to the
   PUBMED database. After a selection of the titles and article summaries
   according to the inclusion criteria, the full versions of the eligible
   articles were read and analysed. Referenced articles of the sources
   articles were added to the analysis. The algorithms described in the
   articles were extracted and analysed. Results: In total, 778 articles
   were identified, 169 were eligible for full reading and 26 articles were
   finally selected. The algorithms listed in the articles are poorly
   described. The description is usually limited to a general explanation
   about how the algorithm works. Seven articles gave a partial description
   of the algorithm; a logic diagram was given in four articles and the
   codes in only two. Actually, only one article fully describes the
   algorithm with its mathematical description, its code and its logic
   diagram. Conclusion: Big Data algorithms in PC are not satisfactorily
   described. The lack of reproducibility is not compatible with a
   consistent scientific approach. Researchers should provide more
   information about the way they extract and analyse their data to give
   their readers more confidence in Big Data.
   Background: As a collaborative project of the Family Practice Depression
   and Multimorbidity group of European General Practice Research Network,
   the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25) scale was identified as
   valid, reproducible, effective and easy to use. Subsequently, it has
   been translated and adapted to 13 languages, including Castilian.
   Currently, the scale is being validated in different languages. Research
   question: What are the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of
   HSCL-25 (HSCL-25e) for depression detection in Primary Care? Methods:
   HSCL-25e was administered to outpatients recruited by their physicians
   in six health centres involved in Spanish EIRA3 study, a trial to
   promote healthy behaviours in people aged from 45 to 75. Patients
   complimented HSCL-25 themselves. Sample size was calculated with R
   package (pROC). Statistical analysis: responsiveness was analysed with
   missing data and detecting ceiling and floor effects for the items.
   Principal component analysis (PCA) was done to determine the dimensions
   of HSCL-25e. Item-total correlation, Cronbach's alpha (global and
   dimensions coefficient) and squared multiple correlation were carried
   out to calculate internal consistency. Results: Seven hundred and
   sixty-nine patients out of 806 complimented HSCL-25e, 738 answered to
   all of the items. No patterns of missing answers were found. No ceiling
   effects, expected floor effect in item 18. Item 17 was the most
   consistent one and item 24 was the lower one. All items showed positive
   discrimination index for both cut-off points (1.55 and 1.75). PCA
   indicated two factors; 13 items corresponding to depression dimension
   and the other 12 items corresponding to anxiety subscale. Global
   Cronbach's alpha was 0.92 (0.88 calculated for depression dimension and
   0.84 for anxiety dimension). Conclusion: The HSCL-25e has excellent
   psychometric properties when applied to Primary Care population. It has
   two dimensions as the original version, although the items included are
   not exactly the same. There are more item coincidences with the French
   version.
   Background: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the first mortality cause
   worldwide with 17.5 million death in 2012. Spices (Scaling-up Packages
   of Interventions for CVD prevention in selected sites in Europe and
   Sub-Saharan Africa) gathered five countries around CVD primary
   prevention interventions, especially for populations with low access to
   prevention and health care system. In France, a rural area where people
   were more deprived and with a low settlement of general practitioners
   (GPs) fitted with the project. Research question: What are the barriers
   and the facilitators for cardiovascular primary prevention
   implementation from caregivers and patients' point of view of a deprived
   rural area? Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted until
   theoretical saturation of data. Purposive samplings of GPs, patients,
   patients' families, nurses and pharmacists were designed. Five interview
   guides explored cardiovascular prevention, cardiovascular health
   promotion in the setting, actors of CVD prevention, capacities for CVD
   prevention, patients' and healthcare professionals' representations,
   barriers and facilitators in implementing CVD prevention, possible
   solutions. Guides were adapted concurrently to the analysis. A blinded
   thematic analysis and a mind-mapping were achieved for each group.
   Results: Thirteen GPS, 11 pharmacists', 14 nurses, 12 patients' and 12
   patients' family members' interviews were achieved. Professionals
   highlighted a disconnection between them and national prevention
   programs, lack of time, payment and training for CVD prevention.
   Countryside was either protective or aggressive regarding CVD risk
   balancing gardening and space against isolation and lack of structures.
   GPs had poor connections with the community. Patients described their
   recklessness and feeling of invulnerability until their CVD appeared.
   Families could be a barrier to CVD prevention and lifestyle change.
   Risky behaviours were handed down from one generation to another.
   Conclusion: Innovative interventions for Spices should focus on these
   community specificities and individual behavioural strategies in
   contrast with the six national plans addressing CVD in France. These
   plans solely concentrate on dissemination of prevention messages and
   knowledge, which is of little use according to this survey.},

Abstract = {Background: The UK has one of the highest rates of teenage pregnancies
   in Western Europe. One-fifth of these are repeat pregnancies. Unintended
   conceptions can cause substantial emotional, psychological and
   educational harm to teenagers, often with enduring implications for life
   chances. Babies of teenage mothers have increased mortality and are at a
   significantly increased risk of poverty, educational underachievement
   and unemployment later in life, with associated costs to society. It is
   important to identify effective, cost-effective and acceptable
   interventions.
   Objectives: To identify who is at the greatest risk of repeat unintended
   pregnancies; which interventions are effective and cost-effective; and
   what the barriers to and facilitators of the uptake of these
   interventions are.
   Data sources: We conducted a multistreamed, mixed-methods systematic
   review informed by service user and provider consultation to examine
   worldwide peer-reviewed evidence and UK-generated grey literature to
   find and evaluate interventions to reduce repeat unintended teenage
   pregnancies. We searched the following electronic databases: MEDLINE and
   MEDLINE In-Process \& Other Non-Indexed Citations, PsycINFO, Cumulative
   Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, The Cochrane Library
   (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of
   Reviews of Effects and the Health Technology Assessment Database),
   EMBASE (Excerpta Medica database), British Nursing Index, Educational
   Resources Information Center, Sociological Abstracts, Applied Social
   Sciences Index and Abstracts, BiblioMap (the Evidence for Policy and
   Practice Information and Co-ordinating Centre register of health
   promotion and public health research), Social Sciences Citation Index
   (supported by Web of Knowledge), Research Papers in Economics, EconLit
   (American Economic Association's electronic bibliography), OpenGrey,
   Scopus, Scirus, Social Care Online, National Research Register, National
   Institute for Health Research Clinical Research Network Portfolio and
   Index to THESES. Searches were conducted in May 2013 and updated in June
   2014. In addition, we conducted a systematic search of Google (Google
   Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) in January 2014. Database searches were
   guided by an advisory group of stakeholders.
   Review methods: To address the topic's complexities, we used a
   structured, innovative and iterative approach combining methods tailored
   to each evidence stream. Quantitative data (effectiveness,
   cost-effectiveness, risk factors and effect modifiers) were synthesised
   with reference to Cochrane guidelines for evaluating evidence on public
   health interventions. Qualitative evidence addressing facilitators of
   and barriers to the uptake of interventions, experience and
   acceptability of interventions was synthesised thematically. We applied
   the principles of realist synthesis to uncover theories and mechanisms
   underpinning interventions (what works, for whom and in what context).
   Finally, we conducted an overarching narrative of synthesis of evidence
   and gathered service user feedback.
   Results: We identified 8664 documents initially, and 816 in repeat
   searches. We filtered these to 12 randomised controlled trials (RCTs),
   four quasi-RCTs, 10 qualitative studies and 53 other quantitative
   studies published between 1996 and 2012. None of the RCTs was based in
   the UK. The RCTs evaluated an emergency contraception programme and
   psychosocial interventions. We found no evidence for effectiveness with
   regard to condom use, contraceptive use or rates of unprotected sex or
   use of birth control. Our primary outcome was repeat conception rate:
   the event rate was 132 of 308 (43\%) in the intervention group versus
   140 of 289 (48\%) for the control goup, with a non-significant risk
   ratio (RR) of 0.92 {[}95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.08]. Four
   studies reported subsequent birth rates: 29 of 237 (12\%) events for the
   intervention arm versus 46 out of 224 (21\%) for the control arm, with a
   RR of 0.60 (95\% CI 0.39 to 0.93). Many repeat conceptions occurred in
   the context of poverty, low expectations and aspirations, and negligible
   opportunities. Service user feedback suggested that there were specific
   motivations for many repeat conceptions, for example to replace loss or
   to please a partner. Realist synthesis highlighted that context,
   motivation, planning for the future and letting young women take control
   with connectedness and tailoring provide a conceptual framework for
   future research.
   Limitations: Included studies rarely characterised adolescent pregnancy
   as intended or unintended, that is interventions to reduce repeat
   conceptions rarely addressed whether or not pregnancies were intended.
   Furthermore, interventions were often not clearly defined, had multiple
   aims and did not indicate which elements were intended to address which
   aims. Nearly all of the studies were conducted in the USA and focused
   largely on African American or Hispanic and Latina American populations.
   Conclusions: We found no evidence to indicate that existing
   interventions to reduce repeat teenage pregnancy were effective;
   however, subsequent births were reduced by home-based interventions.
   Qualitative and realist evidence helped to explain gaps in intervention
   design that should be addressed. More theory-based, rigorously evaluated
   programmes need to be developed to reduce repeat teenage pregnancy in
   the UK.},

Abstract = {When the sick, injured, or dying arrive in a hospital - often along with
   family members - they find themselves on an alien landscape. Elderly
   people enter unfamiliar territory as they move from home or hospital
   into a long-term care setting, which may be the first in a series of
   placements for their final years. African Americans have been subjected
   for decades to oppressive urban planning policies, including `serial
   displacement', which have systematically uprooted and dispersed them,
   their homes, and their places of business and worship. Around the world
   currently, 65 million people are displaced, most trying to escape
   uninhabitable environs involving war, persecution, drought, and famine.
   Some of these migrants and asylum-seekers reside in and around refugee
   camps but many are in urban enclaves or isolated outside them in
   desperately inhospitable conditions. Some are trying to integrate and
   make homes in new countries. Still more people are coming in perilous
   flight from the unfurling effects of climate change. `We are
   place-lings,' according to Ed Casey, `never without emplaced
   experiences'. Lorraine Code, explaining our social and geographical
   embeddedness and interdependence, describes us as `ecological subjects'.
   By recognizing place, we can deepen our appreciation for the ways in
   which we are radically relational, that is, interdependent with people,
   non-human others, and particular locations. This robust and realistic
   conception of our relational nature and its implications for health and
   ethics deserves more attention. Elsewhere I have argued for `ethical
   place-making' as morally obligatory for supporting the capability to be
   healthy, or health justice, for ecological subjects. Drawing on this
   conception of persons as creatures situated in specific social
   relations, geographic locations, and atmospheric and material
   environments, here I emphasize the importance of place and argue for an
   ideal and practice of `ethical place-making' as an essential and,
   indeed, ethically required way of demonstrating and forging future
   solidarity and advancing justice, particularly health justice. The paper
   is organized as follows. In Section 2, I explain what I mean by place
   and examine the relationships, revealed by contemporary research in
   social epidemiology, between place and health. In Section 3, I build on
   the conception of persons as ecological subjects to ground what Carol
   Gould has called `solidaristic recognition', which, as I will interpret
   it, requires us to reckon with the significance of place in our
   relational nature. I then link solidaristic recognition to the ideal and
   practice of ethical place-making and, in turn, the capability to be
   healthy, that is, health justice. I argue that place-based interventions
   should be principal and prioritized ways of showing solidarity and
   promoting justice - especially health justice - for ecological subjects,
   above all those who are displaced and/or insecurely placed. Where
   solidaristic relations do not prevail, ethical place-making has the
   potential to catalyze and nurture them and, over time, to advance
   justice.
   A full discussion of the complex and contested relationship between
   solidarity and global justice is beyond the scope of what I can expound
   on here; I follow - and present concrete manifestations of - the views
   of Iris Marion Young and Carol Gould in seeing solidarity as having, as
   Gould puts it, a crucial `role not only in motivating people's
   commitment to the realization of global justice but {[}also]
   contribut{[}ing] to its construction or constitution.' In Section 4, I
   present examples of ethical place-making inspired by solidaristic
   recognition in a range of domains significant for bioethics - clinical
   and long-term care and urban planning in the United States and
   Netherlands, and refugee care and resettlement in Lebanon and Germany.
   In the cases presented, I describe how the particular elements of
   ethical place-making, emerging from solidaristic recognition, are
   realized, and so support the conditions for the capability to healthy,
   or health justice. Following this discussion, I move on to the
   conclusion. Place `is no fixed thing'. The accounts of geographers,
   philosophers, and some architects emphasize our embodied experience in
   or around place(s), place's significance for the development of our
   subjectivity and identity, and, finally, the complex social processes
   that help to create, maintain, and transform places (and, in turn,
   bodies and subjectivities). The understanding I follow here defines
   `place' in terms of the material environment, and how we, as embodied
   beings, move in, absorb, shape and are shaped by it, and how we, as
   social agents, interact with and within it, gather and attach particular
   meanings, and forge relationships and identities. A growing body of
   research in social epidemiology using realist methods explains in
   increasingly rich, if grim, detail the ways in which social conditions
   and features of the external environment, including place-related
   factors, affect health and longevity, and contribute to preventable
   health inequities. We are talking about components of the built
   environment, like land use, housing design, materials and quality,
   street layout and transportation, exposure to toxins, and violence,
   access to food and activity options; and urban design or decline. Air
   and water quality, and access to green space are other place-related
   factors. We should also include climate and the potential in specific
   locations for climate-related disasters in our scope of concern.
   So-called `determinants' such as these operate independently and
   interactively at various levels and in different contexts to generate
   harms to health and health inequities. On terrain more typical for
   bioethics, clinical and other care settings, as currently configured,
   are notoriously disorienting, anxiety-inducing, and in some ways
   dangerous for physical, psychological, and existential health.
   Researchers have detailed a range of effects of institutional design,
   including the effects of noise and light on recovery times, and the ways
   architecture can shape interactions and experiences. Long-term care
   settings are infamous for poor conditions. A lack of light, private
   space, and access to the outdoors, for example, and isolation from
   broader social surroundings, adversely affect the health of elderly
   people. People fleeing war, persecution, and famine endure desperate
   conditions that threaten health. Many reside in camps (in the form of
   transit camps and official refugee camps, detention centers, etc.
   ) while others dwell in slums or other settlements - primarily in urban
   areas - segregated from the majority population. These people suffer
   from a range of complex physical and mental health conditions. Before or
   during transit and in camps and other settings, they face food
   insecurity, risk of communicable disease, fear, violence, loss, and
   other experiences. If there is access to health services it is often
   restricted to acute medical care, and not equipped to adequately address
   chronic or mental health conditions or the social determinants of health
   needs. Migrants and asylum-seeking people thus lack crucial capabilities
   to be healthy. It is not that a relationship between place and health is
   a modern epiphany. Hippocrates' Airs, waters, and places, the
   epidemiological work of Louis-Rene Villerme and Rudolph Virchow in the
   19th century, and the histories of public health and urban planning, all
   recognized the importance of environmental conditions. The asylums for
   the mentally ill in the late 19th century reveal an attention, if not
   yet evidence-based, for place in care and healing. Inspired by the Moral
   Treatment movement, New Enlightenment intellectuals, and health
   advocates like Dorthea Dix, Thomas Kirkbride established professional
   guidelines on institutional layout and room design for patients. Realist
   methods in social epidemiology, more recently, have deepened our
   appreciation and understanding of the processes at work on our corporeal
   nature, and our entanglement with the world around us. We are situated
   socially, materially, and geographically, and vulnerable as creatures
   who need care and who also need to `fit' with the places in which we
   dwell and through which we navigate. We are, in short, ecological
   subjects, beings for whom social interdependence and geographic
   locatedness are vital. As I will argue below, health justice, or the
   capability to be healthy, therefore demands thoughtful attention to
   place and the conditions that create and sustain places. In the next
   section, I explain the relationship between recognizing people as
   ecological subjects and the ideal and practice of solidarity.
   Solidarity, as I will define it, refers to reaching out through engaging
   our moral imaginations across social and/or geographic distance and
   asymmetry to recognize and assist others who are vulnerable, in some
   cases, acutely, and, over time, advance justice. As a practice,
   solidarity involves two core `enacted commitments'. The first commitment
   is to engaging our moral imaginations and recognizing others in need, or
   what I will describe below as solidaristic recognition. The second
   commitment is to responsive action. This hybrid definition draws upon
   the inspirational work of Iris Marion Young, Carol Gould, Fuyuki
   Kurasawa, and Prainsack and Buyx, all of whom build upon a long and rich
   history of interpretations of solidarity. Recognizing the suffering of
   the displaced and others who are `implaced' in conditions unable to
   sustain them follows from the most minimal appreciation of people as
   ecological subjects, relational creatures who are densely enmeshed in
   social relations as well as spatial locations. While my analysis differs
   substantially, to describe this here I use Carol Gould's term,
   `solidaristic recognition'. Gould distinguishes between what she calls
   `rigorous recognition' and `generous recognition'.
   Rigorous recognition appreciates the equality of all people through an
   essentially cognitive process involving an acknowledgment of our fellow
   humanity. The generous genre, which she recasts as `solidaristic
   recognition', involves empathy, or an affective link with others, and
   focuses on our `mutual interdependence and common needs'. Solidaristic
   recognition conceives of others as `equal in their difference', that is,
   their distinctive social group membership and individual particularity.
   On my own interpretation, solidaristic recognition has two varieties,
   neither of which relies on empathy: basic and relational, responsible
   recognition. If we conceive of people in ecological terms, basic
   recognition (similar to Gould's `rigorous recognition') might be
   expanded beyond its appreciation of everyone's equal moral worth to take
   account of the significance of place for the equitable flourishing of
   all ecological subjects. This most basic form of recognition
   acknowledges that we are equal in part because we all share a need to be
   `in place' in settings that can sustain us and support our capacities. A
   second, more ethically responsible, form of recognition I will call
   relational solidaristic recognition emerges from reckoning more
   thoroughly with our radically relational nature as ecological subjects.
   This reckoning demands that we conceive of ourselves and others as
   embedded but also that we understand that we are constitutive of one
   another and our environs. Geographers have described this in terms of
   the intersubjectivity of identity and place. In her philosophical
   account of ecological subjectivity, Lorraine Code underscores the idea
   that we are `made by and making {[}our] relations in {[}asymmetrical]
   reciprocity with other subjects and with horizontal ellipsis multiple,
   diverse locations'. Seeing not just identities, but also, critically,
   place in relational terms, highlights `the variety of interactions
   between people who are located differently that go into making places'.
   As Iris Young puts it, we `dwell together' in `complex, causal'
   relations of interdependence and in specific atmospheric and material
   conditions on earth in geographic regions and neighborhoods, in homes,
   and institutions of care and employment. We ecological subjects, then,
   contribute to the construction of place - often unintentionally -
   through actions and interactions within a larger context of social
   structures and processes. These structures and processes serve to enable
   some people in the realization of their capacities, yet constrain
   others, creating and/or sustaining structural injustice. This is
   evidenced, for example, in urban planning policies that spawn
   residential segregation or global economic and trade policies that
   compel health care workers to migrate and deepen health inequities in
   source countries. While basic solidaristic recognition can allow for or
   has the potential to generate ethical place-making, relational
   recognition understands the ways that our own subjectivities,
   identities, and places of dwelling as ecological subjects are formed in
   relation to other identities in other places and, crucially, that this
   generates responsibilities for justice. It is in this sense that
   relational solidaristic recognition is a more responsible form: it
   appreciates better-situated ecological subjects' contributions to the
   injustice suffered by the displaced or precariously placed, and aspires
   to respond and work toward promoting justice.
   Responsiveness , an important epistemic and, in turn, ethical capacity,
   is a crucial element for enactments of solidarity in the view I want to
   develop. Both Joan Tronto and Elise Springer assign `responsiveness' a
   prominent place in their work. Springer situates `responsiveness' within
   virtue ethics. On her view, it involves a kind of adaptability,
   particularly in unfamiliar moral terrain, or in the face of concerns
   that `resist clear representation'. Springer posits responsiveness as
   also involving a commitment to `extend a temporally continuous thread of
   attention' or giving one's moral attention over time, not episodically
   or reactively. Tronto identifies responsiveness as one of four ethical
   elements of care, casting it as a moral capacity that involves vigilance
   `to the possibilities for abuse that arise with vulnerability'. I would
   add another element as integral to responsiveness, drawn specifically
   from ecological epistemology: an ability to show finely tuned
   sensitivity to context, that is, the particularity of people and
   circumstance, and give attention and action that is fitting. Solidarity,
   enacted, should emerge from a disposition committed to responsiveness
   understood in terms of these capacities, if it is to meet the mark. In
   the next section I turn to responsive action that arises from
   solidaristic recognition, in particular, efforts at place-making for the
   displaced. Innovation, inspired by ecological thinking and increasingly
   evidence-based, is underway. `Place-making' is a set of intentional
   practices spanning different disciplines that targets neighborhoods,
   parks and paths, features of landscape, housing developments,
   streetscapes, long-term care facilities, and hospitals. With and without
   attention to health, it is either referenced explicitly or somehow
   central to key international documents and declarations including the
   Sustainable Development Goals and UN Habitat's New Urban Agenda. It is
   on the agendas of the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers
   for Disease Control (CDC), even the World Bank, some think tanks and
   foundations, and a major US corporation. Public health leaders point to
   place-based interventions as `the new frontier'. In other work I have
   interpreted ethical place-making, a notion that first surfaced in the
   geography literature, as a core component of an enabling,
   capabilities-oriented conception of justice. Grounded in ecological
   thinking and an ecological conception of persons, ethical place-making
   understands all people as embedded socially and spatially, and often
   enmeshed in relationships of structural injustice that threaten health.
   Key elements of ethical place-making include: nurturing relations of
   care and interdependence; protecting bodily integrity; supporting
   autonomy, not interpreted in terms of individual self-reliance, but in
   the relational sense that sees us as originating, persisting, and
   flourishing within relations of care and interdependence, given ongoing
   opportunities for self-directed thought and action; promoting stability
   and a sense of rootedness and, at the same time, supporting generative
   movement; and finally, where necessary, responding to inequities. Below
   I offer selected examples of place-making drawn from a range of domains
   pertinent to bioethics.
   After describing them, I explain why they count as instances of ethical
   place-making inspired by (and potentially generating more) solidaristic
   recognition and how they stand to promote - especially health - justice
   and in some cases address health inequities. I start at the level of
   community and public health with an urban planning example, and from
   there, turn to a clinical and then a long-term care setting. These three
   case studies come from the global north. The final examples explore
   (mostly health-centered) place-making efforts in refugee reception and
   resettlement, sketching innovations in Germany and also Lebanon, a
   country that borders the war in Syria and ranks fourth worldwide as a
   host to refugees. Further research will yield additional instances of
   solidarity and place-making, particularly for health, in other parts of
   the world.
   In {[}a] system of the city as weaving, {[}creating] crosswise threads
   enables solidarity, and fundamental to solidarity is the free system of
   movement horizontal ellipsis `Intentional shrinkage', `sorting', and
   `serial displacement' are terms given to the urban land use and
   `development' policies that systematically shredded the social and
   material fabric in and around African American neighborhoods in New York
   City. Public health researchers have linked these policies and the
   consequent displacement of families, businesses, churches and more, to
   the AIDS epidemic, addiction, asthma, post-traumatic stress, and
   obesity. Working together, citizens, planners, and researchers responded
   with the Giraffe Path (GP), a 6-mile trail from Central Park to the
   Cloisters. The walking and biking path is a project emerging explicitly
   from the kind of solidarity described above: the recognition of the city
   and its people as ecologically embedded, with enduring health inequities
   as a result of displacements, and responsive action in the form of
   (re)creating place with and for ecological subjects. The GP is based on
   a conception of the city and its neighborhoods and residents as
   interdependent - and is designed to restore connections between formerly
   fractured communities around and across the Harlem River and, at the
   same time, to support outdoor physical activity. The closure of the
   bridge, that had long linked neighbors, as a `crime-prevention' measure
   for gentrifying neighborhoods, severed (in a pattern repeated in cities
   everywhere) relationships between people according to categories of
   class and race. By (re)connecting places and people and mending - as its
   designers say, `weaving', `re-stitching' - the GP helps restore these
   and cultivate new relations. At the same time, as part of the City Life
   Is Moving Bodies (CLIMB) Project, the GP's creation of flow and
   unimpeded movement is being celebrated as `a victory for the city's
   entire circulatory system'. The attention paid to (solidaristic
   recognition of) the importance of place for health and most
   significantly, health inequities, in this instance of ethical
   place-making is an exception and not the norm. Urban renewal policies
   and planning tend to prioritize physical, economic, and social issues,
   yet few focus explicitly on health or show concern for health equity.
   Another essential dimension for future solidarity is the potential for
   political engagement generated by the GP.
   As Iris Young argues (and the inset quote implies), segregation obscures
   from the affluent an appreciation of their privilege, and, by limiting
   interaction, constrains political communication. This erodes the
   potential for solidarity and perpetuates social injustice. The GP
   designers aspire to promote solidaristic recognition through
   facilitating new interactions, forging new relations, and evolving as
   ecological subjects.
   We must pay attention to the lived spatial significance of patients'
   experience of health and illness if we are going to treat them fully and
   well. Doing so is one step of paying attention to a person horizontal
   ellipsis The terrain and overall ambience of the clinical setting is
   famously hostile to non-medical people, notably the ones it exists to
   serve. Place-centered innovation in hospitals and other centers of care
   is a growing niche, recognizing the harms done to ecological subjects -
   here patients and their families - in the `care' of institutions built
   as medical assembly lines organized around time until discharge or
   demise. One neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at the Royal United
   Hospital in Bath, U.K., recognizes the importance of place for the
   health and well-being of vulnerable ecological subjects and puts into
   practice a concept known as `secure base', which wraps around patients
   and families `like a hug'. The unit's design also demonstrates
   solidarity with them in recognizing the effects of typical clinical
   settings and, in contrast, boasts lots of natural light, greatly reduced
   noise, private nooks, and a horseshoe-shape design that reflects the
   progression a newborn will take from intensive care to a neonatal room.
   In this case of ethical place-making, innovators aim to create a habitat
   that nurtures overlapping relations of care wherein babies sleep longer,
   and parents are perhaps a little less distressed, and more able to
   participate in care and interact with clinical care providers. As noted
   above, the structure of this temporary dwelling enables families to
   better understand, through their embodied experience, the clinical
   pathway the infants will follow until discharge, which in turn likely
   gives a boost to their sense of agency and empowerment and helps to
   level the playing field with clinicians. Designed by a long-term care
   nurse in response to her observations and experience of existing
   institutions, Hogeway Village accommodates elderly people with dementia
   in a setting meant to resemble a real European neighborhood. It has a
   market, cafe, salon, theater, sidewalks, and ample green space.
   Different models, tailored to appeal to specific social and cultural
   groups, are available. Staff engage with residents without clinical garb
   and simultaneously provide skilled care. Family members are integrally
   involved in care plans. Hogeway is built to protect yet not restrict,
   allowing residents a wide range of movement and access to the outdoors.
   The availability of palliative care ensures that residents do not have
   to relocate at the end of life, which allows for continuity of care and
   relationships. Another benefit is that family members need not navigate
   new terrains, or settings, of care or transportation as elders' needs
   evolve. Emerging research on long-term care settings designed more like
   homes and communities suggests that residents are more socially engaged
   and active, and experience better overall `well-being'.
   Preliminary evidence also suggests that integrating families in care can
   improve relations with care workers, as well as resident care and
   health.
   European cities and regions have demonstrated their horizontal ellipsis
   willingness to express solidarity with horizontal ellipsis the world's
   refugees via participation in resettlement. Solidarity is at the moral
   center of humanitarian action, and place-making by other names has long
   been integral to humanitarian operations. From an emphasis on emergency
   and temporary assistance, humanitarians have expanded the scope and
   practice of `solidarity' given the nature of current conflicts and the
   creation of dependencies that may lead to more sustained commitments.
   Their work now increasingly overlaps with development efforts to bolster
   host countries' capacities to receive, resettle, and integrate
   asylum-seekers and other migrants for the long term. Solidarity, indeed,
   is the basis of commitments to refugee resettlement in international
   humanitarian law. In 2004, the Mexico Plan of Action to Strengthen
   International Protection of Refugees in Latin America (MPA), which
   encompassed regional responsibility sharing, the expansion of
   resettlement space, reception capacity, and long-term integration,
   highlighted solidarity as a guiding principle for support of refugees
   from Columbia and their host countries. Northern Europe has been the
   preferred destination for refugees from Syria and other places where war
   has driven people from their homes. Germany, especially its cities,
   hosts more recent asylum-seekers than any other EU nation. Urban areas
   have absorbed two-thirds of the world's refugees and now face the work
   of integration. The region offers myriad examples of efforts in ethical
   place-making spawned by solidaristic recognition. In both Hamburg and
   Berlin, organizing around place has been a key strategy in welcoming and
   helping to integrate new arrivals. In Berlin, city planners have
   employed a strategy of creating container villages to help refugees feel
   secure and foster a sense of embeddedness-in-community. While
   formalized, state-administered efforts have unfolded, citizen volunteers
   have designed innovative responses to link refugees with needed
   services, helping to integrate them and provide a sense of place. The
   coordinated state and civil society effort, in particular, is an
   inspiring example of politically and socially constructed solidarity,
   supported and advanced by what Christine Straehle calls a `cosmopolitan
   avant-garde' of citizens. Hamburg is also innovative in linking services
   across sectors like food, shelter, education, work skills, and legal
   advice, appreciating the importance of integrating services for those
   who have endured profound dispersion and fragmentation. The city
   addressed housing needs by redesigning existing buildings and engaged
   local communities in deciding on locations in order to help ensure a
   welcoming, safe environment and avoid the possibility of local
   neighborhood resistance. The countries, such as Jordan, Lebanon, and
   Turkey that serve as the principal hosts to refugees fleeing Syria,
   Afghanistan, and elsewhere, are organizing around so-called `resilience'
   strategies, which aim at bolstering host countries' capacities to accept
   and integrate asylum-seekers and other migrants for the long-term. This
   management philosophy deserves more sustained discussion. I highlight
   here another civil society initiative involving ethical place-making.
   In Lebanon during the war (1975-1990) public spaces were among the most
   dangerous places. Now they serve as temporary shelter areas for migrants
   and refugees displaced from neighboring conflict who face fear,
   discrimination, and violence in their new environs. In this context, one
   architect saw an opportunity: `I thought by promoting place-making in
   Lebanon we can join the efforts of local {[}civil society] actors, since
   horizontal ellipsis place-making is based on networking and bringing
   people together.' With his guidance, youth in Beirut participated in
   identifying and recreating public spaces with the aims of reducing
   violence, promoting inclusion, interaction, and community-building.
   Along with place-making for the sake of social integration, place-based
   interventions in healthcare services are surfacing in response to
   contemporary migration patterns. Adapting to the mobility of many
   displaced people who are, not accessing services in camps, for instance,
   humanitarian and local actors have reorganized healthcare delivery. The
   Blue Dot Hubs developed by UNHCR and partners to provide care and
   services to people en route are a specific example of a response - a
   place-making intervention to `changing therapeutic geographies' in
   modern crises. In the context of resettlement, interventions focused on
   the creation of `therapeutic landscapes' aim specifically at displaced
   children as they resettle in new countries. Through recultivating
   cultural traditions, building social networks, and creating safe places,
   young people can create new homes. These examples depict different modes
   of displacement and distinct populations situated in specific kinds of
   settings and in particular - yet in all cases asymmetrical - relations
   of power. In each case, responsive action, keenly sensitive to context,
   emerges from solidaristic recognition, either basic or relational. In
   some cases it aims explicitly at justice. We can see specific elements
   of solidarity-sparked ethical place-making across cases. Support for
   relations of care is at the heart of the efforts made in the Bath NICU
   and Hogeway Village designs, and also in the GP and initiatives for
   refugees. Attention to the need for rootedness and movement is
   manifested in these civil society efforts to welcome and create
   material, social, economic, and political space for refugees; it is also
   an organizing principle for the GP, Hogeway, and Bath's NICU.
   Transformative autonomy is evident in the GP, the therapeutic landscape
   projects, Hogeway, and the NICU. Attention to inequities, especially
   health inequities, motivates the GP and Blue Dot Hubs. In all, the
   creators - architects, designers, planners, carers, and citizens -
   recognize the `users', let us say `dwellers', as ecological subjects and
   respond with concerned attention to their distinctive needs, in real
   time and over time with the aim of supporting their capabilities,
   chiefly to be healthy, and in some cases to remedy injustice. I have
   argued that recognizing all people as ecological subjects enables us,
   indeed compels us, to forge relations of solidarity and promote justice
   through ethical place-making with those who are vulnerable through their
   insecure relationship to place.
   On the moral landscape(s) of bioethics, an ethic of place-making
   expresses and has rich potential for nurturing bonds of solidarity along
   with advancing health, social, and global justice with patients and
   families, elderly people transitioning to long-term care, urban
   populations confronting health inequities, asylum-seekers dwelling in
   precarious conditions, and perhaps others. The author declares no

   INTRODUCTION PLACE AND HEALTH: ECOLOGICAL SUBJECTS ECOLOGICAL
   SUBJECTIVITY AND SOLIDARITY Solidaristic recognition Responsiveness
   SOLIDARITY (AND HEALTH JUSTICE) ENACTED: ETHICAL PLACE-MAKING Community
   and public health Care settings Refugee assistance and integration The
   elements of ethical place-making CONCLUSION CONFLICT OF INTEREST
   Footnotes Drawing on a conception of people as `ecological subjects',
   creatures situated in specific social relations, locations, and material
   environments, I want to emphasize the importance of place and
   place-making for basing, demonstrating, and forging future solidarity.
   Solidarity, as I will define it here, involves reaching out through
   moral imagination and responsive action across social and/or geographic
   distance and asymmetry to assist other people who are vulnerable, and to
   advance justice. Contained in the practice of solidarity are two core
   `enacted commitments', first, to engaging our moral imaginations and
   recognizing others in need and, second, to responsive action.
   Recognizing the suffering of displacement and responding through
   place-making should follow from even the most simplistic understanding
   of people as `implaced'. Recognition, furthermore, that places are
   created and sustained, transformed, or neglected in ways that foster or
   perpetuate inequities, including health inequities, generates
   responsibilities concerning place-making. Place-based interventions, on
   either count, should be principal and, indeed, prioritized ways of
   showing solidarity for the vulnerable and promoting justice. Where
   solidaristic relations do not prevail, place-making can catalyze and
   nurture them, and over time advance justice. On the moral landscapes of
   bioethics, the terrain where care and health are or should be at the
   center of attention, an ethic of place and place-making for those who
   have been displaced - patients, the elderly, urban populations, and
   asylum-seekers, for instance - expresses and has rich potential for
   nurturing bonds of solidarity.},
